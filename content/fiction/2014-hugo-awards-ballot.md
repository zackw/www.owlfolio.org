title: 2014 Hugo Awards ballot
date: 2014-07-29 21:51
slug: 2014-hugo-awards-ballot
...

I'm not attending [the Worldcon](http://www.loncon3.org/), but I most
certainly am voting the [Hugos](http://www.thehugoawards.org/) this
year, and moreover I am publishing my ballot with one-paragraph
reviews of everything I voted on. If you care about this sort of thing
you probably already know why. If you don't, the short version is:
Some of the works nominated this year allegedly only made the
shortlist because of bloc voting by
[Larry Correia](http://monsterhunternation.com/)'s fans, he having
published a
[slate of recommendations](http://monsterhunternation.com/2014/03/25/my-hugo-slate/).

There's nothing intrinsically wrong with publishing a slate of
recommendations—don't we all tell our friends to read the stuff we
love?  In this case, though, the slate came with a bunch of political
bloviation attached, and one of the recommended works was written by
"<abbr title="you do not want to visit his website">Vox Day</abbr>,"
who is such a horrible person that even your common or garden variety
Internet asshole backs slowly away from him, but nonetheless he has a
posse of devoted fanboys and sock puppets. A
[frank exchange of views](http://www.salon.com/2004/06/25/frank_exchange/)
ensued; be glad you missed it, and I hope the reviews are useful to
you anyway. If you want more detail,
[Far Beyond Reality has a link roundup](http://farbeyondreality.com/2014/04/19/2014-hugo-nominations-the-reactions/).

I value characterization, sociological plausibility, and big ideas, in
that order. I often appreciate ambitious and/or experimental stylistic
choices. I don't mind an absence of plot or conflict; if everyone
involved is having a good time exploring the
[vast enigmatic construction](http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/macrostructures),
nothing bad happens, and it's all about the mystery, that's just fine
by me.  However, if I find that
[I don't care what happens to these people](http://fanlore.org/wiki/Eight_Deadly_Words),
no amount of plot or concept will compensate. In the context of the
Hugos, I am also giving a lot of weight to novelty. There is a lot of
stuff in this year's ballot that has been *done* already, and the
prior art was much better. For similar reasons, volume N of a series
has to be *really good* to make up for being volume N.

<!--more-->

With two exceptions (both movies I didn't get around to) I at least
*tried* to read/watch everything mentioned below, and where I didn't
finish something, that is clearly indicated. This is strictly my
personal strategy for this sort of thing and I am not putting it
forward as right or wrong for anyone else.

Links go to the full text of the nominated work where possible, a
Goodreads or IMDB page otherwise.

Note to other Hugo voters: I'm making pretty heavy use of No Award. If
you mean to do the same, make sure you understand
[the *correct* way to use it](https://theweaselking.livejournal.com/4574210.html):

> **If you want to vote No Award over something, put No Award at the
> end of your ballot and DO NOT list the things you're voting No Award
> over.**

The ballot below (unlike the ballot I submitted) includes line items
below No Award, so that I have a space to explain my reasons.

## Best Novel

1. **[Ancillary Justice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333324-ancillary-justice)**, Ann Leckie

    Let's get one thing out of the way first: this book features the
    Roman Empire (with aspects of Persia and China and probably a
    couple others I missed), IN SPACE! That was out of fashion for
    quite some time, and rightly so, on account of having been done to
    death. However, it has been long enough that a genuinely fresh take
    is acceptable, if done well, and I happen to think this was done
    very well. It does not glorify conquest, but neither does it paint
    the conquerors a uniform shade of Evil; it depicts a multitude of
    cultures (more than one on the same planet, even!); it has
    realistic-given-the-setting stakes and conflicts of interest, and
    believable characters both human and otherwise. I might not have
    chosen to tell the story out of temporal sequence; one does spend
    an awfully long time wondering *why* the protagonist's goals are as
    they are. But I see why Leckie did it the way she did it.

    Nearly every review of this novel talks about the thing where the
    protagonist's native language doesn't make gender distinctions and
    so [e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spivak_pronoun) is always
    picking the wrong casemarkers, pronouns, etc. when speaking
    languages that do. I kinda wish they wouldn't focus so much on
    that, because it is just one aspect of a larger problem the
    protagonist has: e *didn't used to be a human being* and is, over
    the course of the novel, having to learn how to be one. E doesn't
    know how to handle eir 'irrational' attachment to Lieutenant
    Seivarden either, and eir problem-solving strategies *start out*
    much more appropriate to the entity e used to be and progressively
    become suited to eir current state. It is also neither the most
    unusual nor the most interesting thing about Radchaai culture. I
    don't believe I have *ever* before seen Space Romans with a state
    religion, a system of clientage, or a plot driven by a political
    quandary that the real Romans (as far as I understand) actually
    had.

2. **[Neptune’s Brood](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15985402-neptune-s-brood)**, Charles Stross

    This reminds me of
    *[The Witches of Karres](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/317621.The_Witches_of_Karres),*
    in a good way. Distant-future setting, check. Packed to the gills
    with ideas, check. Self-contained storyline, check. Extraordinarily
    high stakes, check. Hardly anyone has any idea what's going on, but
    they don't let that stop them, check. It's technically a sequel,
    but it might as well be a standalone novel, which is fortunate,
    because I bounced off
    *[Saturn's Children](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2278387.Saturn_s_Children)*
    really quite hard---the protagonist here is more congenial company,
    and the society depicted, more plausible. The plot is fundamentally
    a MacGuffin hunt, but played in a novel and entertaining manner.

    Strictly in terms of the story, this is neck and neck with
    *Ancillary Justice*, but it falls short on writing technique. There
    was a great deal of infodumpage, paired with excessive showing of
    work---at one point the first-person narrator actually says "I am
    now going to bore you to death with $TOPIC." I *like* geeking out
    about political economy, but not at the expense of the
    narrative. (Continuing with the comparison to *The Witches of
    Karres*, Schmitz was much better at giving the reader just barely
    enough detail.) The ending is almost Stephensonian in its
    abruptness, and a little too pat---it sounded good at the time, but
    half an hour later I found myself unconvinced that the MacGuffin
    would have its stated consequences. Finally, there's an irritating
    and frequent stylistic quirk, in which multi-clause sentences are,
    incorrectly, punctuated with colons instead of semicolons.

3. **[Parasite](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13641105-parasite)**,
    Mira Grant

    You know how the movie studios sometimes do A/B testing to decide
    which of several different edits of a movie to release as the
    finished product? I want to do that with this book. Specifically, I
    want to find out whether or not it'd be a better book if there
    weren't page-length quotations from in-universe documents at the
    beginning of each chapter.  These documents make it much clearer
    what is actually going on, which is a good thing in that the reader
    might be completely lost without them, and a bad thing in that the
    reader can (as I did) figure out exactly where the plot is going by
    the end of chapter 2.

    It's reasonably well written, modulo some clumsy infodumpage in the
    middle, and it is a credible attempt to write a stock type of
    thriller novel (exactly which type would be a spoiler) without
    making the science completely laughable. Bonus points for actually
    being familiar with the geography, traffic headaches, and cultural
    diversity of the San Francisco Bay Area. However, it is, in the
    end, a stock type of thriller novel, and may not appeal if you
    don't already like that sort of thing.  (If you get to the end of
    chapter 2 and find yourself thinking "ugh, this is clearly going to
    be about X" ... yeah, you can go ahead and put the book down.)

4. **No Award**

5. **[The Wheel of Time](https://www.goodreads.com/series/41526-the-wheel-of-time)**,
    Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson

    The rules need to be changed so that completed gargantua-series are
    their own category, or perhaps some sort of special award,
    considering there might or might not *be* any completed
    gargantua-series in any given year. I'd be showing up at the
    business meeting with a revision proposal if I were attending the
    Worldcon.

    Perennial latecomer to cultural phenomena that I am, I didn't even
    notice that these novels existed until there were about seven of
    them, at which point the consensus on USENET (yeah, it was that
    long ago) seemed to be that they were not terribly inventive and
    the plot had ceased to make forward progress. So I didn't bother
    picking them up. The Hugo voters' packet contains *the entire
    thing* in one giant e-book file. I am on the last leg of a long
    plane flight as I type this, and I have just finished the first 8%
    of that e-book, i.e. *The Eye of the World*. I enjoyed it well
    enough, as it happens, and will probably continue reading the
    series as further long plane flights, sick days, and similar
    present themselves. If I don't get too fed up with the plot failing
    to make forward progress, I may even finish it someday.

    However, based on that volume plus the aforementioned USENET
    commentary and what I've heard from other people since, it is not
    Hugo quality, for three reasons. First and foremost, as I was told
    so long ago, it is not at all inventive. The setting is exactly
    what was being skewered by
    [_The Tough Guide to Fantasyland_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/47510.The_Tough_Guide_to_Fantasyland).
    Worse, the plot of the first novel is
    [Campbell's monomyth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth),
    _verbatim_. (Well, the first few stages of it.) It escapes
    "Extruded Fantasy Product" territory only by virtue of having a
    whole bunch of characters who, at this point anyway, are all
    three-dimensional people with plausible motivations and most of
    whom are entertaining to watch. Second, I don't have a lot of
    patience for whiny teenagers who spend much of the book
    [refusing the call to adventure](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RefusalOfTheCall),
    distrusting the adults who actually know what's going on, or both
    simultaneously. Yes, they've spent all their lives hearing stories
    starring the Aes Sedai as villains, but c'mon, Moiraine repeatedly
    saves everyone's life at great personal cost, it could maybe occur
    to you that there might've been a bit of a smear campaign going on?
    Third, Jordan's tendency to pad the plot is already evident in this
    one volume. It did not need to be 950 pages long.

6. **[Warbound, Book III of the Grimnoir Chronicles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130317-warbound)**,
    Larry Correia

    Noir-flavored urban fantasy, set in an alternate 1930s USA where
    people started developing superpowers (of the comic book variety)
    in roughly 1880. I would *love* to read a *good* detective noir
    with superheroes and/or fairy tale magic. This, however, is yet
    another jingoistic retread of the Pacific theater of the Second
    World War, shifted into the middle of the Great Depression, with
    The Good Guys (USA! USA! with superheroes) versus The Bad Guys
    (Imperial Japan circa 1934---an excellent choice if you like your
    Bad Guys utterly evil, I'll admit---with supervillains) and a
    secret society trying to emulate
    [Charles Xavier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_X) and
    failing at it because they're too busy arguing and scheming. I
    almost gave up fifty pages into volume I because no sympathetic
    protagonists had yet appeared. Fortunately, someone whose story I
    was interested in *did* appear shortly thereafter, but it was still
    pretty slim pickings all the way to the end. This is not a case of
    bad characterization; it's that most of the characters are
    unpleasant, petty, self-absorbed, and incapable of empathizing with
    people who don't share their circumstances. Additional demerits for
    setting the story in the Great Depression, and then making nearly
    everyone we're *supposed* to like, wealthy.

    Ironically, one of the most sympathetic characters in the entire
    trilogy is the leader of Imperial Japan (known almost exclusively
    as The Chairman)—I think this was because Correia knew he needed a
    villain who *wasn't* cut from purest cardboard, but it didn't occur
    to him that he needed to put as much work into his heroes. And by
    the same token, it did not occur to him that he had failed to
    convincingly refute his villain's philosophy: if your villain
    espouses the rule of the strongest, and is then defeated by
    superior technology, intellect, and strength of will, *that in
    itself only demonstrates that force of arms is weaker than those
    things.*

    Regarding Larry Correia's recommendation slate, all I care to say
    is that his taste in writing by others reflects the flaws in his
    own writing.

## Best Novella

1. **“[Wakulla Springs](http://www.tor.com/stories/2013/10/wakulla-springs)”**,
    Andy Duncan and Ellen Klages

    Apart from a few unexplained-and-might-not-even-have-happened
    phenomena near the very end, this could be historical fiction with
    no speculative elements. Wakulla Springs is a real place and they
    really did film _Tarzan_ and _The Creature from the Black Lagoon_
    there, and they really did turn various animals loose in the
    Florida swamps when they were done. However, if you squint at it a
    different way, it's a fairy tale moved to the twentieth century,
    not any _specific_ fairy tale but the bones of them all, with movie
    stars standing in for kings and princes, and rubber-suit monsters
    standing in for, well, monsters. And the characters are all just
    fun to be around.

2. **[Six-Gun Snow White](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16104414-six-gun-snow-white)**,
    Catherynne M. Valente

    This is overtly a fairy tale, specifically _Snow White_, moved to
    the nineteenth-century Wild West and shook up in a blender with the
    style and the form of the stories of Coyote. The first half of it
    is compelling, and the third quarter works okay, but the conclusion
    is disappointing. The problem is that if you're going to retell
    _Snow White_, either you have to stick with love conquering all in
    the end (and you have to set that up proper), or you have to jump
    the tracks _before_ Snow White eats the poison apple. And if you're
    going to set Snow White up as a mythic hero after the fashion of
    Coyote, maybe you should give her at least some of Coyote's
    miraculous ability to get back _out_ of trouble? Valente
    deliberately avoided doing any of those things and so painted
    herself into a corner.

    Having said that, I'm still giving this the #2 slot because I
    really like the _concept_, and it only fails by not executing
    successfully on its grand ambitions, which is a thing I am prepared
    to cut an author some slack for.

3. **“[Equoid](http://www.tor.com/stories/2013/09/equoid)”**,
    Charles Stross

    Marvelously creepy cryptozoological meditation on unicorns, their
    life cycle and role in the ecosystem, and why they must be
    exterminated. In the
    [_Laundry Files_](https://www.goodreads.com/series/50764-laundry-files)
    continuity, and does not stand alone terribly well. Also, stay away
    if you dislike body horror.

4. **No Award**

5. **“[The Chaplain’s Legacy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22385887-the-chaplain-s-legacy)”**,
    Brad Torgersen

    Remember what I said above about things that have been done
    already?  This is a retread of
    [_Enemy Mine_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enemy_Mine_%28novella%29),
    breaking no new ground itself. Characterization is flat and style
    pedestrian. Not so boring as to make me put it down in the middle,
    and thankfully didn't go for the cheap moral that I thought it
    would, but on the whole, disappointing.

6. **[The Butcher of Khardov](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18106542-the-butcher-of-khardov)**,
    Dan Wells

    An extended character study of an antihero of the most boring,
    clichéd, and overdone type: mistreated due to his size and
    strength, doubly mistreated due to his uncanny abilities, learns
    from betrayal to take everything personally, believes the only
    thing he's good at is killing people, and in his secret heart, just
    wants to be loved. Overflowing with
    [manpain](http://fanlore.org/wiki/Manpain). Told out of
    chronological order for no apparent reason, causing the ending to
    make no sense. Vaguely folktale-Russia setting (with steampunk and
    magic) that a better writer could have done something interesting
    with; I am given to understand that this is in fact the
    [WARMACHINE](http://privateerpress.com/WARMACHINE) tabletop
    wargaming setting. I do not object to tie-in fiction, but neither
    will I cut it any slack on that account. For instance, the Butcher
    himself is an official WARMACHINE character; I don't know if Wells
    invented him or just got tapped to flesh out his backstory;
    regardless, I do not consider that a valid excuse for any of the
    above.

## Best Novelette

1. **“[The Waiting Stars](http://aliettedebodard.com/short-stories/the-waiting-stars/)”**,
    Aliette de Bodard

    This one is difficult to describe without spoiling it, so I'll just
    say that it's a clash-of-cultures story, set in the extremely far
    future, and I liked how the two cultures are both somewhat
    sympathetic despite valuing very different things and being
    legitimately horrified by the other's practices. The ending may be
    laying it on a little too thick, but I don't know that it can be
    toned down without spoiling the effect.

2. **“[The Lady Astronaut of Mars](http://www.tor.com/stories/2013/09/the-lady-astronaut-of-mars)”**,
    Mary Robinette Kowal

    Elma, the titular Lady Astronaut, was on the first manned
    expedition to Mars; that was thirty-odd years ago, and she is now
    semi-retired, living on Mars, and torn between getting back into
    space and taking care of her husband, who is dying. Apart from the
    setting, this could be mainstream literary fiction, and a type of
    mainstream literary fiction that, as a rule, rubs me *entirely* the
    wrong way. This one, however, I liked.  The characters all seem
    genuine, and the setting throws the central question of the plot
    into sharp relief, forcing us to take it more seriously than we
    might otherwise have.

3. **“[The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling](http://subterraneanpress.com/magazine/fall_2013/the_truth_of_fact_the_truth_of_feeling_by_ted_chiang)”**,
    Ted Chiang

    Philosophical musing on the nature of memory and how technological
    aids change that. This used to be a professional interest of mine,
    but I didn't think Chiang did all that much with it here. Told in
    two intertwined narratives, of which the story of the
    [Tiv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiv_people) is more compelling,
    or perhaps it is just that the first-person narrator of the other
    half is kind of a blowhard.

4. **No Award**

5. **“[The Exchange Officers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22399099-the-exchange-officers)”**,
    Brad Torgersen

    Near future plausible geopolitical conflict in low Earth orbit, POV
    first person smartass grunt-on-the-front-line. Entertaining, but
    neither memorable nor innovative.

6. **“<abbr title="you do not want a link to this one">Opera Vita
    Aeterna</abbr>”**, Vox Day

    This isn't a story; it's an object lesson in
    [why publishers reject 95--99% of the slush pile](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/004641.html). The
    prose is uniformly, tediously purple, and nearly all of it is spent
    on description of rooms, traditions, and illuminated
    manuscripts. The characters haven't even got one dimension. Nothing
    happens for the first two-thirds of the text, and then everyone in
    the monastery (it takes place in a monastery) is, without any
    warning, murdered, cut to epilogue. To the extent I can tell what
    the author thought the plot was, it could be summarized in a
    paragraph without losing anything important, and it would then need
    a bunch of new material *added* to make it into a story.

    I've seen several other people say that this is bad but not
    terrible, comparing it positively to
    [_The Eye of Argon_](http://ansible.uk/misc/eyeargon.html),
    and I want to explicitly disagree with
    that. [If I may quote Sarah Avery](http://www.blackgate.com/2011/08/03/teaching-fantasy-ii-in-which-i-knowingly-assign-the-worst-short-story-in-the-history-of-sword-and-sorcery/),
    _The Eye of Argon_ has characters; in the course of the story,
    something happens; several somethings, even, with some detectable
    instances of cause and effect; and it has a beginning, a middle,
    and (in some versions of the text) an end. It's clichéd, sure, and
    and crammed full of basic grammar and vocabulary errors, and that's
    what makes it
    [bad in a hilarious and memorable way](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SoBadItsGood). _Opera
    Vita Aeterna_, by contrast, is
    [bad in a _boring_ and _forgettable_ way](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/DarthWiki/SoBadItsHorrible),
    which is _worse_.

    There is no doubt in my mind that this is only on the ballot
    because it was included in Correia's recommendations and then
    bloc-voted onto the shortlist by Day's fanboys. To them I say: if
    you did not realize it was unworthy, you should be ashamed of
    yourself for being so undiscerning; if you knew it was unworthy and
    you nominated it anyway, you have committed a sin against Apollo,
    and may you live to regret it.

## Best Short Story

These are all good enough that rank-ordering them is hard; I'd be happy
to see any of them win. They are also all floating somewhere around the
[magical realism](http://www.writing-world.com/sf/realism.shtml)
attractor, which is not what I would have expected.

1. **“[The Water That Falls on You from Nowhere](http://www.tor.com/stories/2013/02/the-water-that-falls-on-you-from-nowhere)”**,
    John Chu

    Tell a lie, even a white lie, or even fail to admit the truth, and
    water falls on you from nowhere; this just started happening one
    day---otherwise this is a story of ordinary people and their
    troubles and their connections to each other, and the magic is used
    to explore those things. Very elegant in its use of language; bonus
    points for making use of the ways in which Chinese (Mandarin,
    specifically, I think) describes family relationships differently
    than English does.  Emotionally fraught, but satisfying.

2. **“[Selkie Stories Are for Losers](http://www.strangehorizons.com/2013/20130107/selkie-f.shtml)”**,
    Sofia Samatar

    I always did wonder what happened to the children after the selkie
    went back to the ocean. Not so much the husband. The husband got
    what was coming to him, which is the point of the selkie story
    itself; but the daughter, who usually is the one to find the skin
    that the husband's kept locked in the attic or wherever; she didn't
    have it coming, did she?

    A kind storyteller might have it be that the daughter goes down to
    the ocean every Thursday afternoon, while the husband is out
    fishing, and her mother comes up from the waves and they have
    tea. Sofia Samatar is not a kind storyteller.

3. **“[The Ink Readers of Doi Saket](http://www.tor.com/stories/2013/04/the-ink-readers-of-doi-saket)”**,
    Thomas Olde Heuvel

    Based on a real Thai festival,
    [Loi Krathong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loi_Krathong); in the
    story, the paper boats that are floated down the river contain
    wishes for the new year. The villagers of Doi Saket consider it
    their duty to collect the wishes and send them onward to Buddha in
    paper lanterns ... and some of them, somehow, come true. Is it the
    intervention of the river goddess? Is it all just coincidence? Is
    it a scam to line the pockets of the village chief? It's hard to
    tell. You will reach the end of this story not being sure what
    happened, and you will reread it and still not be completely
    sure. But it's a fun read anyway.

4. **“[If You Were a Dinosaur, My Love](http://www.apex-magazine.com/if-you-were-a-dinosaur-my-love/)”**,
    Rachel Swirsky

    A very, very old theme, here, but a take on it that would have been
    impossible not so long ago. I'm not sure it's a *story*,
    though. More of a love poem. Or a curse poem. Bit of both,
    really. Still, it's going to haunt me.

## Best Graphic Story

1. **“[Time](http://geekwagon.net/projects/xkcd1190/)”**, Randall
    Munroe

    Back in 2005 I doubt anyone would have guessed that the new
    nerd-joke webcomic on the block, [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/), would
    still be around in 2013 (over a thousand strips later), let alone
    that it would run a 3101-panel epic starring two stick figure
    people who are building sandcastles on the beach … really elaborate
    sandcastles … meanwhile discussing why the ocean level seems to be
    rising up … and then setting off in search of the source of the
    river, since presumably that's where the extra water is coming from
    … and it just keeps elaborating from there. It was presented in an
    inconvenient format (the link goes to a more accessible
    compilation), but it's got everything one could want in an SFnal
    epic: engaging characters (it's amazing how much characterization
    Munroe can pack into pithy dialogue among stick figures), a
    carefully thought-out setting, the joy of discovery, the thrill of
    the unknown, a suitably huge problem to be solved, and, of course,
    Science!

2. **[Saga](https://www.goodreads.com/series/84668-saga), Volume 2**,
    written by Brian K. Vaughan, illustrated by Fiona Staples

    A love story against the backdrop of an endless galaxy-shattering
    war, sung in the key of
    [gonzo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_journalism), and
    influenced by the best bits of everything from
    [*Métal Hurlant*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9tal_Hurlant)
    to [*Tank Girl*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Girl) to
    [*Tenchi Muyo!*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenchi_Muyo!) It's
    hard to tell where it's going; what we have so far could be
    summarized as "Romeo and Juliet IN SPACE! Neither of them is a
    teenage idiot, they're determined to survive, and their respective
    sides are coming after them with as much
    [dakka](http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Dakka) as they can scrape together
    on short notice." The A-plot may not even have appeared onstage at
    this point. One thing's for sure, though: Vaughan and Staples mean
    to put on one hell of a show. For a more in-depth description I
    refer you to
    [io9's review](http://io9.com/10-reasons-you-should-be-reading-brian-k-vaughan-s-sag-756300575).

    Strictly in terms of the content, I could just as easily have
    placed this in the #1 slot. "Time" gets the nod because _Saga_ is
    not quite as novel, because the subplot with The Will and The Stalk
    seemed icky and gratuitous, and because volume 1
    [won this category last year](http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/2013-hugo-awards/).

3. **[Girl Genius, Volume 13: Agatha Heterodyne & The Sleeping City](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20121221)**,
    written by Phil and Kaja Foglio; art by Phil Foglio; colors by
    Cheyenne Wright

    I love *[Girl Genius](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/)*, but it's
    won this category three times already
    [(in a row, yet!)](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php?date=20110831)
    and this volume, while continuing to be quality material, is
    nonetheless more of the same.

4. **No Award**

5. **“[The Girl Who Loved Doctor Who](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18686773-the-girl-who-loved-doctor-who)”**,
    written by Paul Cornell, illustrated by Jimmy Broxton

    What if the Doctor fell through a crack in time and landed in
    *this* universe, where he is a fictional character? Not a new
    conceit, but one with legs, and I think you could build a fine
    _Doctor Who_ episode around it; unfortunately, this is not that. It
    is too heavy on the self-referential and meta-referential, to the
    point where I think it only makes sense if you are familiar with
    the show *and* its fandom.  The story is rushed so that they can
    pack in more in-jokes, and the coda takes a turn for the
    [glurge](http://www.snopes.com/glurge/glurge.asp).

6. **[Meathouse Man](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17334949-meathouse-man)**,
    adapted from the story by George R.R. Martin and illustrated by
    Raya Golden

    I think this was _meant_ to be a deconstruction of the notion that
    for everyone there is a perfect romantic partner out there
    somewhere, just one, and all you have to do is find them and your
    life will be perfect forever. Which is a notion that could use some
    deconstructing.  Unfortunately, between the male gaze, the embrace
    of the equally-in-need-of-deconstruction notion that men cannot
    comprehend women, the relentlessly grim future backdrop, and the
    absence of plausible character motivations, what you _get_ is not
    deconstruction but enforcement by inversion: The only thing that
    can fix a man's shitty life is the perfect romantic partner, but he
    will never find her, so he should just give up and embrace the
    hollow inside. (Gendered words in previous sentence are
    intentional.) I regret having finished this.

## Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form

1. **[Gravity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/)**, written by
    Alfonso Cuarón & Jonás Cuarón, directed by Alfonso Cuarón

    This is probably as close as you can get to the ideal golden age
    hard-SF Protagonist versus Pitilessly Inhospitable Environment
    story in movie format. (I have actually seen this abstract plot
    done with precise conformance to the laws of orbital mechanics:
    [*Lifeboat*, by James White](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2716526-lifeboat).
    But storytelling suffered for it.) There are places where they go
    for the cheap wrench at your heart, but then there are places where
    they *don't* do the obvious and clichéd thing, and this movie isn't
    really about the plot, anyway, it's about the spectacle. Clearly
    groundbreaking in terms of cinematography, also; I look forward to
    future use of the technology they developed. For more, please go
    read [my friend Leonard's review](http://www.crummy.com/2013/11/01/0),
    as he is better at critiquing movies than I am.

2. **[Pacific Rim](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663662/)**, screenplay
    by Travis Beacham & Guillermo del Toro, directed by Guillermo del Toro

    It's a giant monster movie, but it's a *really well thought through
    and executed* giant monster movie. (Except for the utterly
    nonsensical notion of building a wall around the entire Pacific
    Ocean, which let us pretend never happened.) And I like that the
    scientists save the day by doing actual experimental science. Bonus
    points for *not* going grimdark or ironic or anything like
    that. Yes, earnest movies in which there was never any real doubt
    that the good guys would win were worn out in the 80s and 90s. But
    bleak movies in which there aren't any good guys to begin with, and
    nothing ever really changes, certainly not for the better, are worn
    out here in the 2010s. Further bonus points for a close personal
    relationship between a man and a woman which does not turn into a
    romance.

3. **[Iron Man 3](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1300854/)**,
    screenplay by Drew Pearce & Shane Black, directed by Shane Black

    Marvel continues to crank out superhero movies which do interesting
    things with established characters. (I particularly liked, in this
    one, that Potts gets her own *independent* source of superpowers
    and does not require rescuing, and that Stark is forced to work out
    his overprotectiveness issues on his own time.) However, in the
    end, it is another superhero movie with established characters. I
    said to someone on a convention panel back in 2001 that I wished
    Marvel and DC would allow their superheroes to come to the end of
    their stories, and I still feel that way.

4. (my official vote for this category ended at this point)

5. **[Frozen](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2294629/)**, screenplay by
    Jennifer Lee, directed by Chris Buck & Jennifer Lee

    I didn't get around to seeing this; I'm sure it's another
    respectable installment in the field of Disneyified fairy tale, but
    I can't really imagine its breaking new ground.

6. **[The Hunger Games: Catching Fire](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1951264/)**,
    screenplay by Simon Beaufoy & Michael Arndt, directed by Francis
    Lawrence

    I didn't get around to seeing this either, and I'm frankly more
    than a little burnt out on YA dystopia.

## Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form

I have to abstain from this category, because I watch TV shows ages
after everyone else does; I imagine I'll get to current _Doctor Who_
episodes (for instance) sometime in 2024.

## Best Related Work

I _wanted_ to vote this category, but I have run out of time to read
things, so I have to skip it as well.

## Best Semiprozine, Best Fanzine, Best Fancast, Best Editor, Best Professional Artist, Best Fan Artist, Best Fan Writer

And _these_ categories, I have no idea how to evaluate.

## The John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer

Several of the qualifying works in this category are head and shoulders
above everything that was nominated in the regular categories! I will
definitely be looking out for more writing by Samatar and Gladstone, and
maybe also Sriduangkaew.

1. **Sofia Samatar** (*[A Stranger in Olondria](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12814333-a-stranger-in-olondria)*)

    A form I haven't seen attempted in some time: the travelogue of a
    fantastic land. In this case, Olondria is a great city, perhaps the
    greatest in the world, filled with merchants, priests, and books,
    and the traveler/narrator is a humble farmer from the islands in
    the south, come to Olondria to sell his peppers, as his father did
    before him.  Well, that's what everyone back at home expects him to
    do, anyway. In truth he has fallen in love with the literature of
    Olondria and, through the books, the city itself, and never had all
    that much interest in the family business to begin with. And then
    the plot catches up with him: there are two sects of those priests,
    and both wish to use him to advance their own interests: for you
    see, he is haunted by the ghost of a woman of his own people, whom
    he barely knew, but whom he was kind to in her last illness...

    This has got everything one could possibly want in a work of SF
    _and_ everything one could possibly want in a work of capital-L
    literature; the form is elegant and fitted precisely to the
    content; the characters are engaging, the narrative flows smoothly,
    one does not want to put it down. As I mentioned above, Sofia
    Samatar is not a kind storyteller; this book is painful to read in
    places. But, having completed it, you will not regret the journey.

1. **Max Gladstone**
    (*[Three Parts Dead](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13539191-three-parts-dead)*,
    *[Two Serpents Rise](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16059411-two-serpents-rise)*)

    Alternate-Earth (and you have to pay close attention to realize
    that it _is_ Earth) fantasy. All gods are real, but many of them
    are dead; the wizards (excuse me, "Craftsmen") made war on them and
    slew them, claiming their power in the name of humanity. That was
    some hundred years ago, and the world is still finding a new
    equilibrium. Each of these books shows a different piece of that,
    with very little overlap.  Plotwise they are both mysteries, of the
    'investigation of a small incident leads to something bigger
    ... _much_ bigger ...' type, which I liked; it allows the stakes to
    be appropriately high while avoiding all of the overused quest
    fantasy tropes. And it works well for showing the readers lots of
    little details that illustrate how this is not the world we
    know. Gladstone is also excellent at characterization; even the
    NPCs who are only onstage in a scene or two feel fully realized.

    The only complaints I have are that the way the magic works kinda
    squicks me out a little (this may have been intentional) and that
    the ending of _Two Serpents Rise_ didn't quite work for me (in a
    way which would be too spoilery to explain here).

1. **Benjanun Sriduangkaew**
    ("[Fade to Gold](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22465778-fade-to-gold)";
    "[Silent Bridge, Pale Cascade](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/sriduangkaew_12_13/)";
    "[The Bees Her Heart, the Hive Her Belly](http://mythicdelirium.com/?page_id=1973)")

    These are short stories. "Fade to Gold" is a variation on a
    Southeast Asian folktale, starring two people trapped by their
    natures and the demands of society; creepy, sorrowful, tragic. The
    other two are far-future magical-realist meditations on the nature
    of family, loyalty, and history in a setting where everyone's
    memory is remotely editable.  All are good, but the far-future ones
    may not be to everyone's taste: e.g. if you don't care for magical
    realism, or for stories where it's not clear exactly what happened
    even after you've read all of it.

1. **Ramez Naam** (*[Nexus](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13642710-nexus)*)

    Near-future technothriller in which an elixir of brain-augmenting
    nanomachines, street name Nexus, offers people the chance to become
    'posthuman'...or could be abused to enslave humanity. Three
    different organizations are struggling to control it, and the
    protagonists, who just want to be left in peace to experiment on
    their own minds, are caught in the middle. Generally a fun read;
    occasionally clunky prose (particularly in fight scenes);
    overspecific about gadgets in use (lots of technothrillers do this
    and I don't understand why). I am a little tired of cheap drama
    achieved by poor communication between people who are nominally on
    the same side.

    Brain-augmenting nanomachinery, and the United States of America
    sliding into police state-hood, seem to be in the zeitgeist right
    now. I've seen both done with a lot more nuance: this gets
    obnoxiously preachy in places. (Recommendations in this category
    with more nuance:
    [Smoking Mirror Blues](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/453651.Smoking_Mirror_Blues),
    [A Girl and her Fed](http://www.agirlandherfed.com/main?i=1&p=about).)

1. **No Award**

1. **Wesley Chu** (*[The Lives of Tao](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15981711-the-lives-of-tao)*)

    I gave up on this after three chapters. The story concept could
    have been interesting---two factions of immortal, nonphysical
    aliens, battling in the shadows of Earth's history, possessing
    humans and using them to carry out their plans---but it's got major
    problems on the level of basic storytelling craft. Those first
    three chapters are one page after another of unnecessary detail,
    repetition of information the audience already has, grating shifts
    in tone, boring conversations about trivia, and worst of all,
    self-spoilers. Maybe two pages' worth of actual story happened, and
    a good chunk of that probably shouldn't have happened on stage
    (because it was a self-spoiler). And I had been given no reason to
    care what happened to the characters.
