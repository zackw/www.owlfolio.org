The results are in for the
[2014 Hugo Awards](http://www.thehugoawards.org/2014/08/2014-hugo-award-winners/).
I'm pleased with the results in the fiction categories---a little sad
that
"[The Waiting Stars](http://aliettedebodard.com/short-stories/the-waiting-stars/)"
didn't win its category, but it *is* the sort of thing that would not
be to everyone's taste.

Now that it's all over, people are
[chewing over the politics of this year's shortlist, particularly the infamous "sad puppy" slate](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2014/08/17/thoughts-on-the-hugo-awards-2014/),
over on John Scalzi's blog, and this was going to be a comment there,
but I don't seem to be able to post comments there, so y'all get the
expanded version here instead. I'm responding particularly to this
sentiment, which I believe accurately characterizes the motivation
behind Larry Correia's
[original posting of his slate](http://monsterhunternation.com/2014/03/25/my-hugo-slate/),
and the motivations of those who might have voted for it:

> I too am someone who likes, and dislikes, works from both groups of
> authors. However, only one group ever gets awards. The issue is not
> that you cannot like both groups, but that good works from the PC
> crowd get rewarded and while those from authors that have been
> labeled “unacceptable” are shunned, and that this happens so
> regularly, and with such predictability that it is obviously not
> just quality being rewarded.

I cannot speak to the track record, not having followed genre awards
closely in the past. But as to this year's Hugo shortlist, it is my
considered opinion that all the works I voted below No Award (except
*The Wheel of Time*, whose position on my ballot expresses an
objection to the eligibility rules) suffer from *concrete, objective
flaws* on the level of basic storytelling craft, severe enough that
they did not deserve a nomination. This happens to include Correia's own
novels, and all the other works of fiction from his slate that made the
shortlist. Below the fold, I shall elaborate.

(If you're not on board with the premise that there is such a thing as
objective (observer-independent) quality in a work of art, and that
observers can evaluate that independently from whether a work suits
their own taste *or* agrees with their own politics, you should
probably stop reading now. Note that this is not the same as saying
that I think all Hugo voters should *vote* according to a work's
objective quality. I am perfectly fine with, for instance, the people
who voted "Opera Vita Aeterna" below No Award without even cracking it
open---those people are saying "Vox Day is such a despicable person
that no matter what his literary skills are, he should not receive an
award for them" and *that is a legitimate critical stance.* It is
simply not the critical stance I am taking right now.)

Let me first show you the basic principles of storytelling craft that
I found lacking. I did not invent them; similar sentiments can be
found in, for instance,
"[Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses](http://twain.lib.virginia.edu/projects/rissetto/offense.html),"
the
[Turkey City Lexicon](http://www.sfwa.org/2009/06/turkey-city-lexicon-a-primer-for-sf-workshops/),
Ursula LeGuin's
[*Steering the Craft*](https://www.powells.com/biblio/62-9780933377479-1),
Robert Schroeck's
[*A Fanfic Writer's Guide To Writing*](http://www.accessdenied-rms.net/guide/fwg.txt),
and Aristotle's
[*Poetics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetics_%28Aristotle%29).
This formulation, however, is my own.

> 1. Above all, a story must not be boring. The reader should *care*,
>    both about
>    "[what happens to these people](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EightDeadlyWords),"
>    and
>    about the ultimate resolution to the plot.
> 2. Stories should not confuse their readers, and should enable
>     readers to anticipate---but not perfectly predict---the
>     consequences of each event.
> 3. The description, speech, and actions of each character in a story
>    should draw a clear, consistent picture of that character's
>    personality and motivations, sufficient for the reader to
>    anticipate their behavior in response to the plot.
> 4. [Much like music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war),
>    stories should exhibit dynamic range in their pacing, dramatic
>    tension, emotional color, and so forth; not for nothing is
>    "monotony" a synonym for "tedium."
> 5. Style, language, and diction should be consistent with the tone
>    and content of the story.
> 6. Rules 2--5 can be broken in the name of Art, but doing so demands
>    additional effort and trust from the reader, who should, by the
>    end of the story, believe that it was worth it.

With that in hand, I shall now re-review the works that didn't deserve
(IMNSHO) to make the shortlist, in order from most to least execrable.

### *Opera Vita Aeterna*

This is textbook bad writing. The most obvious problem is the padded,
purple, *monotonously* purple prose, which obviously fails point 4,
and less obviously fails point 5 because the content isn't
sufficiently sophisticated to warrant the style. The superficial flaws
of writing are so severe that it's hard to see past them, but if you
do, you discover that it fails all the other points as well, simply
because there wasn't enough *room*, underneath all of those purple
words, for an actual plot. It's as if you tried to build a building
entirely out of elaborate surface decorations, without first putting
up any sort of structural skeleton.

### *The Butcher of Khardov* and *Meathouse Man*

These are both character studies, which is a difficult mode: if you're
going to spend all of your time exploring one character's personality,
you'd better make that one character *interesting*, and ideally also
fun to be around. In these cases, the authors were trying for
tragically flawed antiheroes and overdid the anti-, producing
characters who are nothing *but* flaw. Their failures are predictable;
their manpain, tedious; their ultimate fates, banal. It does not help
that they are, in many ways, the same extruded antihero product that
Hollywood and the comic books have been foisting on us for going on
two decades now, just taken up to 11.

*Khardov* also fails on point 2, being told out of order for no
apparent reason, causing the ending to make no sense. Specifically, I
have no idea whether the wild-man-in-the-forest scenes are supposed to
occur before or after the climactic confrontation with the queen, and
the resolution is completely different depending on which way you read
it.

*Meathouse Man* was not on Correia's slate. It's a graphic novel
adaptation of
[a story written in the 1970s](https://grrm.livejournal.com/322366.html),
and it makes a nice example of point 6. *When it was originally
written*, a story with a completely unlikable protagonist, who takes
exactly the wrong lessons from the school of hard knocks and thus
develops from a moderate loser into a complete asshole, would perhaps
have been ... not a breath of fresh air, but a cold glass of water in
the face, perhaps. Now, however, it is nothing we haven't seen done
ten billion times, and we are no longer entertained.

### *The Chaplain's Legacy* and *The Exchange Officers*

These are told competently, with appropriate use of language, credible
series of events, and so on. The plots, however, are formula, the
characters are flat, the ideas are not original, and two months after
I read them, I'm hard pressed to remember enough about them to
criticize!

I may be being more harsh on Torgerson than the median voter, because
I have read
[*Enemy Mine*](http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?41444) and so I
recognize *The Chaplain's Legacy* as a retread. (DOES NO ONE READ THE
CLASSICS?!) Similarly, *The Exchange Officers* is prefigured by
hundreds of works featuring the Space Marines. I don't recall seeing
remotely piloted mecha before, but mecha themselves are cliché, and
the "remotely piloted" part sucks most of the suspense out of the
battle scenes, which is probably why it hasn't been done.

### *The Grimnoir Chronicles*

Correia's own work, this falls just short of good, but in a way that
is *more* disappointing than if it had been dull and clichéd. Correia
clearly *knows how* to write a story that satisfies all of the basic
storytelling principles I listed. He is never dull. He comes up with
interesting plots and gets the reader invested in their outcome. He's
good at set pieces; I can still clearly envision the giant monster
terrorizing Washington DC. He manages dramatic tension effectively,
and has an appropriate balance between gripping suspense and calm
quiet moments. And he is *capable* of writing three-dimensional,
nuanced, plausibly motivated, sympathetic characters.

It's just that the only such character in these novels is the
principal villain.

This is not to say that all of the other characters are flat or
uninteresting; Sullivan, Faye, and Francis are all credible, and most
of the other characters have their moments. Still, it's the Chairman,
and *only* the Chairman, who is developed to the point where the
reader feels fully able to appreciate his motivations and choices. I
do not say sympathize; the man *is* the leader of
[Imperial Japan circa 1937](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War),
and Correia does not paper over the atrocities of that period---but he
does provide more justification for them than anyone had in real
life. There really is a cosmic horror incoming, and the Chairman
really does think this is the only way to stop it. And that makes for
the best sort of villain, *provided you give the heroes the same depth
of characterization*. Instead, as I said last time, the other
characters are all by habit unpleasant, petty, self-absorbed, and
incapable of empathizing with people who don’t share their
circumstances. One winds up hoping for enough reverses to take them
down a peg. (Which does not happen.)

### Conclusion

Looking back, does any of that have anything to do with any of the
authors' political stances, either in the real world, or as expressed
in their fiction? Not directly, but I do see a common thread which can
be interpreted to shed some light on *why* "works from the PC crowd"
may appear to be winning a disproportionate number of awards, if you
are the sort of person who uses the term "PC" unironically. It's most
obvious in the Correia, being the *principal* flaw in that work, but
it's present in all the above.

See, I don't think Correia *realized* he'd written all of his Good
Guys as unpleasant, petty, and self-absorbed. I think he unconsciously
assumed they didn't need the same depth of character as the villain
did, because *of course* the audience is on the side of the Good Guys,
and you can tell who the Good Guys are from their costumes
(figuratively speaking). It didn't register on him, for instance, that
a captain of industry who's personally unaffected by the Great
Depression is maybe going to come off as greedy, not to mention
oblivious, for disliking Franklin Delano Roosevelt and his policies,
even if the specific policy FDR was espousing on stage was a genuinely
bad idea because of its plot consequences. In fact, that particular
subplot felt like the author had his thumb on the scale to make FDR
look bad---but the exact same subplot could have been run without
giving any such impression, if the characterization had been more
thorough. So if you care about characterization, you're not likely to
care for Correia's work or anything like it. Certainly not enough to
shortlist it for an award honoring the very best the genre has to
offer.

Now, from out here on my perch safely beyond the Overton window,
"politically correct," to the extent it isn't a vacuous pejorative,
means "something which jars the speaker out of his daydream of the
[lily-white suburban 1950s of America](https://encrypted.google.com/books?id=yH1upjtj4OYC&pg=PA69)
[(possibly translated to outer space)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podkayne_of_Mars),
[where everything was pleasant](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120789/)."
(And I do mean *his*.) Thing is, that suburban daydream is, still, 60
years later, in many ways the default setting for fiction written
originally in English. Thanks to a
[reasonably well-understood bug in human cognition](http://shwetanarayan.tumblr.com/post/95298073266/lets-talk-about-category-structure-and),
it takes *more effort* to write fiction which avoids that default. It
requires constant attention to ensure that presuppositions and details
from that default are not slipping back in. And most of that extra
effort goes into---characterization. It takes only a couple sentences
to state that your story is set in the distant future Imperium of Man,
in which women and men alike may serve in any position in the military
and are considered completely equal; it takes constant vigilance over
the course of the entire novel to make sure that you don't have the
men in the Imperial Marines taking extra risks to protect from enemy
fire those of their fellow grunts who happen to be
women. [Here's another, longer example illustrating how much work can be involved](http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/blog/archives/000976.html).

Therefore, it seems to me that the particular type of bad
characterization I disliked in the above works---writing characters
who, for concrete in-universe reasons, are unlikable people, and then
expecting the audience to cheer them on anyway because they've been
dressed up in These Are The Heroes costumes---is *less likely* to
occur in writing that would get labeled "works from the PC crowd." The
authors of such works are already putting extra effort into the
characterization, and are therefore less likely to neglect to write
heroes who are, on the whole, likable people whom the reader wishes to
see succeed.
