Let's talk about something more fun, shall we?  These were my
nominations for the [2016 Hugo Awards](http://www.thehugoawards.org/).
The final ballot will be announced on April 26.  Hugo nominations,
unlike final ballots, are not ranked.  I'd be happy to see any of
these things win their categories.

I read a lot of good stuff at novel-length this year, but not enough
shorter fiction to fill all five nomination slots per category.
Something to work harder on next year, I suppose.  (It didn't help
that I spent most of January and February in paper crunch mode.)  I
don't even try to nominate outside the fiction categories.

## Novel

* [Zen Cho](https://zencho.org/),
  _[Sorcerer to the Crown](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23943137-sorcerer-to-the-crown)_.
  If you, like me, have been wishing for a sequel to _Jonathan Strange
  & Mr Norrell_ since the day you finished reading it, you will like
  this book.

* [Naomi Novik](https://www.naominovik.com/),
  _[Uprooted](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22544764-uprooted)_.
  Polish folktale crossed with supernatural horror.  Online reviews
  tend to be all about the characters (whom they either love or hate)
  but the really compelling aspect of this one, IMNSHO, is the evil
  magic forest.

* [Kazuo Ishiguro](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4280.Kazuo_Ishiguro),
  _[The Buried Giant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22522805-the-buried-giant)_.
  It takes some doing to achieve a new take on the Matter of Britain
  nowadays; Ishiguro has pulled it off.

* [Judith Tarr](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/41194.Judith_Tarr),
  _[Forgotten Suns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24290807-forgotten-suns)_.
  Three words: space opera _archaeology_.  Why haven't people done
  more of that?  Yeah, _Stargate_, but it was almost never central to
  the plot.

* [Jo Walton](http://www.jowaltonbooks.com/),
  _[The Just City](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22055276-the-just-city)_.
  Pallas Athene decides to create the allegorical city from Plato's
  _Republic_ in real life, basically to see what happens.

## Novella

* [Usman Malik](https://www.usmanmalik.org/),
  _[The Pauper Prince and the Eucalyptus Jinn](https://www.tor.com/2015/04/22/the-pauper-prince-and-the-eucalyptus-jinn-usman-malik/)_.
  Mughal folktale transposed to the modern world: another "why
  haven't people done more of that?"

* [Warren Ellis](http://www.warrenellis.com/),
  _[ELEKTROGRAD: RUSTED BLOOD](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26069714-elektrograd)_.
  And a third "there should be more of this" category: steampunk
  detective noir.

* [Nnedi Okorafor](https://nnedi.com/),
  _[Binti](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25667918-binti)_.
  Another unusual space operatic setting.  Might not be to everyone's
  taste, particularly if you dislike fish-out-of-water POV protagonist.

## Novelette

* [Rose Lemberg](http://roselemberg.net/),
  "[Grandmother-nai-Leylit’s Cloth of Winds](http://www.beneath-ceaseless-skies.com/stories/grandmother-nai-leylits-cloth-of-winds/)."
  Somewhat clash of cultures, somewhat travelogue, somewhat coming of
  age, and almost certainly nothing like anything you've read before.

## Short Story

* [Zen Cho](https://zencho.org/),
  "[Monkey King, Faerie Queen](http://www.kaleidotrope.net/archives/spring-2015/monkey-king-faerie-queen-by-zen-cho/)."
  Sun Wukong visits the court of the Queen of Air and Darkness, and it
  goes just about as you would expect.

* [Daniel José Older](http://danieljoseolder.net/),
  "[Kia and Gio](https://www.tor.com/2015/01/06/kia-and-gio-daniel-jose-older/)."
  Magical realism set in New York City.

* [Marissa Lingen](https://www.marissalingen.com/),
  "[The Many Media Hypothesis](https://www.nature.com/articles/526286a)."
  What if you were Facebook "friends" with all the alternate possible
  versions of yourself?

* [Laura Pearlman](https://unlikelyexplanations.com/),
  "[I am Graalnak of the Vroon Empire, Destroyer of Galaxies, Supreme Overlord of the Planet Earth. Ask Me Anything.](https://flashfictiononline.com/main/article/i-am-graalnak-of-the-vroon-empire-destroyer-of-galaxies-supreme-overlord-of-the-planet-earth-ask-me-anything/)"
  Alien invasion as Internet-based farce.  It made me laugh.

## Graphic Story

* Sydney Padua, _[The Thrilling Adventures of Lovelace and Babbage](http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/the-book/)_.
  "What if Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage had successfully
  constructed an Analytical Engine?" is _not_ new territory---Bruce
  Sterling did it back in the 80s, and it's often implied background
  for steampunk Victoriana---but doing it as a humorous graphic novel
  which is also a detailed work of historical research, with footnotes
  and references and everything: that deserves recognition.

* "Abbadon,"
  _[Kill Six Billion Demons](https://killsixbilliondemons.com/)_.
  This is worth reading just for the art.  And the incredibly vast
  world that has been built.  The plot is _set up_ like your standard
  "everygirl rescues love interest in distress, taking several levels
  in badass along the way" but I doubt that's where it's going.

* Ru Xu, _[Saint for Rent](https://www.saintforrent.com/)_.
  So often you see time travel stories where the time travel is just a
  way to put people _into_ the interesting historical or futuristic
  situations, and not actually used to its full power.  This is not
  like that.

* Pascale Lepas, _[Wilde Life](https://www.wildelifecomic.com/)_.
  "Oscar rented an old house off craigslist, then things got weird..."
  Creepy rural [Vermont](https://the-toast.net/series/chris-kimball/)
  and creepy rural [Arizona](http://www.welcometonightvale.com/) are
  both well-traveled paths, but how often do you see
  cheerful-yet-creepy rural _Oklahoma?_

* Dave Kellett, _[Drive](http://www.drivecomic.com/)_.
  Relatively straightforward space opera, but lots of fun detail and
  manages to remain tongue-in-cheek while also running a deadly
  serious plot.
