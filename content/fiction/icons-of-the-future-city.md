Way back at the
[2010 Mozilla Summit](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2010), one of the
keynote speakers showed us an amazing
[demo flythrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUOIS3jtD8Y) of a
3D-rendered futuristic city, with embedded video, tweets, and the
like, all running live inside a Firefox 4 beta thanks to awesome new
tech like
[WebGL](http://learningwebgl.com/cookbook/index.php/WebGL:_Frequently_Asked_Questions)
and [JägerMonkey](https://wiki.mozilla.org/JaegerMonkey). (Note: in
the linked video, the city only appears about a minute in.) That’s not
what I want to talk about, though.

It occurred to me while I was watching, that there is a standard
futuristic city used in demos like this one. It’s night. You can’t see
the ground. Skyscrapers stretch all the way to the horizon. Said
skyscrapers are glass oblongs, for the most part; this demo mixed it
up quite a bit with interesting cross-sections, but still had hardly
any ornamentation, terracing, or what-have-you. All the skyscrapers’
windows are lit up. There may be flying vehicles between or around the
towers, but there is no sign of any other type of transportation. It
is, in short, the future of the
[Futurists](http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/) of the nineteen-teens,
the city of
[Metropolis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis_%28film%29),
[Blade Runner](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/), and
[Neuromancer](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/books/neuromancer.asp).

Now the thing is, no city in the real world has ever looked like that.
Even in the densest and most skyscraper-ful urban areas—have a look at
these aerial videos of
[Manhattan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_MqERF6tIY) and
[Hong Kong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwiEuK_4xNE), for
instance—there are buildings that are less than ten stories tall
(these are in fact the majority in Manhattan, although possibly not in
Hong Kong); there are parks and other open spaces; and by no means are
all of the buildings boring oblongs. Furthermore, people doing actual
urban design argue, vehemently, over whether or not dense
skyscraper-ful cities are best (e.g.:
[pro](http://www.futureagenda.org/?p=1001),
[con](http://www.newgeography.com/content/001722-urban-legends-why-suburbs-not-dense-cities-are-future))
and I think nobody would argue, anymore, that open space is
unnecessary.

And yet, when we want an icon of the city of the Future, the
Futurists’ vision is what we turn to. Why? Perhaps because it’s
instantly recognizable, or because it’s easy to build 3D models
for. But I claim this is causing this discredited vision to occupy a
share of the casual imagination that it does not deserve anymore. It
crowds out other visions with its readiness to hand. Let’s invent some
new icons for the future city. Let’s make the *next* demo flythrough
be of something like

or

(But watch out for the just-as-discredited
“[Radiant City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ville_Radieuse)” vision, please.)
