In honor of the Feast of All Fools, and because if anyone has noticed
it, they haven't told me, I hereby announce that there is a joke in
the references of
[my most recently published paper](https://research.owlfolio.org/pubs/2012-stegotorus.pdf).
Whoever first correctly identifies it will win the right to suggest a
joke to be added to my *next* paper, which is currently in
preparation.  Post your guesses in the comments; so as not to spoil it
for anyone, comments will not be visible until after the contest ends.

One guess per person.  Must provide a working email address (or I
won't be able to contact you if you win).  Do not suggest a joke now;
the winner will be notified of the topic of the upcoming paper, so
they can think of something appropriate.  Management reserves the
right to reject joke suggestions, in which case the next person in
line will get a crack at it.
