I was going to write a crunchy, cerebral, if perhaps controversial,
post today about how I don't think Bitcoin is going to change the
world, but then I got up and read my usual newsfeeds and discovered
that, once again, the Internet's collection of
"[gibbering follow monkeys](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2013/01/31/troll-report-active-with-increasing-chance-of-stupid/)"
have decided to hurl abuse up to and including death threats at
someone.  Someone whom, I am not surprised to find, is female and not
white. So now you don't get crunchy, or cerebral. You get an angry
rant, because I have had _enough_ of this shit.

For context, the sequence of events appears to have gone something
like
this. [More details available at GF Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/PyCon_2013_forking_and_dongles_incident).

* Some dudes were making sophomoric, not actually funny sex jokes at
  PyCon.
* Adria Richards complained to the PyCon organizers and also kvetched
  about the dudes on Twitter.
* The PyCon organizers told the dudes to knock it off and/or leave the
  room, which they did.
* The gibbering follow monkeys flipped the fuck out, like they do, and
  started throwing abuse, DDOS and death threats around.
* One of the dudes was fired subsequent to a "thorough investigation"
  by his employer.
* Ms. Richards has also been fired, apparently after the abuse widened
  to include her employer as an organization.

Okay, here comes the rant.

## What. The. Fuck. Is. Wrong. With. You. Monkeys?!

Why is it that this type of incident always seems to provoke a
nuclear-grade shitstorm?

Why is it _so important_ to you to be able to make sophomoric, unfunny
jokes no matter where you may find yourself?

Where on God's green earth did you get the idea that _death threats_
are an appropriate response to ANYTHING?!

Why are you not _ashamed_ of yourselves?

## So tell us how you really feel, Weinberg.

I rather think I just did, but now I'm done shouting, perhaps I will
elaborate a bit.

The "sophomoric, not actually funny sex jokes" may seem like a minor
thing and not worth complaining about, but
[there is a fucking _track record_ here](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Timeline_of_incidents). Much
more serious things can and have happened to women at professional
conventions (both in the software industry and out). By calling out
minor bad behavior and publicly telling the perpetrators to knock it
off, communities
[signal that more serious misbehavior will not be tolerated](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/03/broken-windows/304465/?single_page=true),
and then hopefully it doesn't happen at all. (Note: I am aware that
this has been partially discredited as regards violent crime, but if
you think it doesn't work _at all_, provide evidence to back up your
claims, and be aware that you are arguing with
[Philip Zimbardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Zimbardo).) The
initial "hey, this is not cool" report and the "knock it off" response
by PyCon seem precisely on the nose to me. Should anyone have gotten
fired? Not _just_ because of this incident, certainly, but the
"thorough investigation" by the dude's employer may have turned up
something more serious; they, quite properly, do not
elaborate. (Commenting in public about why you fired someone is a
nonstop ticket to lawsuit land in the USA.) As of this writing,
Ms. Richards' employer appears to be in panic mode and not behaving
rationally; I would not be surprised if they calm down tomorrow and
pretend it never happened.

Now, as to the shitstorm. There is _also_ a track record here, and for
that I'm going to refer you to John Scalzi: "[The Sort of Crap I Don't
Get](http://whatever.scalzi.com/2011/08/31/the-sort-of-crap-i-dont-get/)."
He explains how he gets hate mail because of things he _does_, but he
does not get a continuous stream of abuse, nor is it because of who and
what he _is_ (unless you count "opinionated and widely read"). Anyone
who isn't a straight white male, however, can expect that continuous
stream of abuse, especially if they have a prominent online persona.
This is not okay, and this is what I am especially angry about this
afternoon. I have seen it happen over and over again to friends and
acquaintances and strangers whose writing I read, and what the hell can
I do about it?

I can say "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU MONKEYS" out loud instead of
just thinking it, maybe. Maybe if enough people do that, the monkeys
will start to feel some shred of shame.

I can hope.

Thanks for listening. Have a flower.
