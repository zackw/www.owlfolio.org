Some time ago---I don't remember how long precisely---I started
working on a mixtape. I got as far as writing down a bunch of songs in
categories, and then I lost interest, and the list has been cluttering
up my desk ever since. The category tags no longer make a great deal
of sense and I'm not even sure who sings some of these songs anymore,
but if I put it into the computer then I can get rid of the paper
cluttering up my desk, and maybe the magic of the internets will do
something with it.

My current tastes say there should be less pop and more goth. And some
electronica. And probably also some Cake.
