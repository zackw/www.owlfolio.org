It's not a bad idea, but I am reliably informed that rather a lot of
websites break if you don't send cookies with CSS loads, even
cross-domain (think: authentication-required site serving all "static"
content from a CDN, CDN configured not to reveal anything without the
appropriate cookies).

I am not a fan of Content-Type, but nobody seems to have a better
idea.
