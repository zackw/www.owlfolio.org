A $24,000 basic income for 250 million people (rough guess at those
over 18 in the USA) is 6 trillion dollars a year. That's 33% of the US
GDP, and slightly under twice the entire US Federal budget.

So I assume you are not saying that the government should simply give
everyone $24,000, regardless of other income. (Although that's the
definition of Unconditional Basic Income in the Wikipedia page you
link to...)
