How do you account for the inflation that your idea causes?

The logic problem is simple.  Why is your number set so low for 'basic
income'?  Why not 50k?  Why not 100k?  Why not 1 billion dollars?

What happens to the price of a loaf of bread if I give everyone 1
billion dollars?  Or even in your case 24k.  You have obviously taken
a few econ classes.  Run the curves.

Like many wealth redistribution schemes they work *very* short term.
It is the next iteration 10 years after you want to see what your work
has wrought.

There is a second flaw to your system.  If you want to simplify the
tax system there needs to be 0 deductions (which is what you really
created with the living stipend).  Deductions are how we end up with
complexity and inequality and a form of wage slavery.  Deductions are
a form of slavery.  Your stipend is an even better way to shackle
people.  Do as I say or loose your stipend.  That sort of thing.
