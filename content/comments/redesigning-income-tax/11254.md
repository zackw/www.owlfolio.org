I understand the idea. But I think wholesale theft is too high a price
to pay. (And it wouldn't work anyway.) I define theft as "taking that
which you have no right to", and it doesn't make it legal if people
vote for it. The government has no right to the money I earn if it's
using it for something which is not a valid purpose of government.

So I guess the real discussion, as it always ends up being, is about
the purpose of government. I don't think it's a valid purpose of
government to try and create economic 'equality' by taking from one
group and giving to another. I think the purpose of government is to
create a legal framework (police, courts, contracts, keeping promises)
in which people can be safe and generous to one another. I would love
to see nobody starving, or homeless, or living in poverty. And I would
love to see it done by people like you and me being freely generous
with our time and resources.
