Zack: also, your Unconditional Basic Income - how is it provided?

Are you simply saying that the income tax threshold starts at $24,000
(and so people without a job or with a low-paying job may not actually
have that level of income)? Or does the state give everyone a lump sum
of $24,000 regardless of job status? Or is the minimum wage $24,000,
so everyone in a job gets the basic income but those without a job do
not? Or does the state simply top up your income to $24,000 regardless
of whether or not you have a job? If that's how it works, is there a
minimum wage at all, or not? If not, how do you prevent employers
paying people very little because the state will pick up the slack? If
there is a minimum wage, what is it?
