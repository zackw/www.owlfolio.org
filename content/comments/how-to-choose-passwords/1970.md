Great article, but don't forget to treat secret questions the same
way, because they are basically "master passwords" for sites.  Use
unique passwords as answers for every site, and record the answers in
a safe and secure place. Consider <a

title="Schneier on Security: Write down your passwords"
rel="nofollow">writing them down</a> but do so securely - written
passwords should reside somewhere where you, and only you can access
them - in a safe or lockbox preferably, and on your person where you
will know if they are taken from you if that's not possible.
