A scaling bad guy is fine, IMO, but you are right that it can't
scale linearly with the player- Oblivion did that and it is by far the #1
complaint I hear about the game. Awesome game, but if you spend a few
levels learning non-combat skills, suddenly every little bandit on the
road is running around in uber armor and can kick your ass.

If you want it to look "natural", with each sidequest you perform
that increases your power somehow, the badguy has a few more guards in
place.Not enough to counterbalance the increase in your own power, but
enough that it is clear that he's taking advantage of the time you're
taking to do these quests to beef up security. :)

For your nethack question you're going to have to define "lose". I
would daresay that most RPGs don't actually let you lose in the first
place. (Ultimas IV-VI, for instance, had the King rez you if you
died.) The ones that did just make you go back to the last saved
game. (The SSI goldbox games, which I'm replaying, actually just say
"The monsters rejoice that the party has been destroyed." and then
dump you to DOS!) Nethack and its ilk's uniqueness seems to me more in
the save scum prevention.
