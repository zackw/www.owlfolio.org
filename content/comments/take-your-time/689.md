I remember the "The monsters rejoice ..." line!

The thing with roguelikes is people accept and even embrace the rule
that death means you start the game over.  There are other
single-player games that have similar characteristics (e.g., right now
what my brain wants to do when it's tired is play ridiculously hard
solitaire card games) but none of them have the dozens of hours of
gameplay that goes into a winning roguelike run.  And if you tried to
do "death means start over" with a Final Fantasy or an Ultima I think
people would throw the game across the room in frustration.  So what's
the difference?  Is it just that when you start playing a roguelike
you die dozens of times in the first few levels, so starting over
isn't annoying, and then you're used to it?
