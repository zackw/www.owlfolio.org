It's an old idea, but they've done a really thorough synthesis and a
bunch of practical application; like, they have a story for having one
button that grants a bundle of related permissions, and so on.  I'm
probably going to write a whole post about it after I have time to
read the paper, because I really want to see B2G adopt this model
rather than install-time permission manifests.
