I see having only one MIME type encompassing all font formats as an
<i>improvement</i> over the way things are currently done.  I think it
is <i>wrong</i> to dispatch for per-format processing based on
metadata rather than file contents, and I wish to force people to stop
doing that (and to stop designing file formats which require dispatch
based on metadata because the contents are ambiguous).

I have good reasons for this position, but I think I need to write a
whole article explaining them.  Please stay tuned.
