the idea of application/font is good, but it would break many
implementations. file -ib foobat.ttf would always return
"application/font". Even if it returns
"application/font;container=foo" many programs would strip the part
after ";", since they do the same with ";charset=". mime.types file
(for example used by Lighttpd) could solve this, but as far as I know
the files doesn't contain any metadata behind the MIME
type. Implementation shouldn't be aware of that or use the same
algorithm for stripping everything behind ";".

So even if you deprecate the other MIME type defintitions, it would
take years to change this. Same for font/foobar.
