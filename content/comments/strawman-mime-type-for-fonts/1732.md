I understand the purpose of application/ for anything not
video|image|message etc, but throwing all the font-types into one
application/font mime seems really ugly too. If you’re given
video/x-msvideo, you know what the file is, just not what is
contained… Here are some other lovely suggestions:

    application/font.opentype
    image/font+opentype
