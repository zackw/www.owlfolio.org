Well, that's a tricky case; my attitude is that the information
currently stuffed into the MIME subtype belongs in-band and
<i>only</i> in-band, but <code>file(1)</code> is the program that
other programs invoke to perform inspection of in-band magic numbers,
so it oughta be able to produce more detail if requested.  At present
it is reasonable to insist that any program claiming to handle
"application/font" should handle both common sfnt variants and WOFF
compression, but there might be more divergence in the future, e.g. if
SVG fonts ever take off.

On the whole I'd say do the "application/font;container=foo" thing and
fix the breakage.
