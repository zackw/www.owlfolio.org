There's a tickybox in `View > Zoom` that makes it go back to text-only
zoom - it really, really needs to become a per-site mode like the zoom
level itself, though.  Sometimes zoom-everything looks like ass, and
sometimes zoom-just-text looks like ass, and it's  not the page's
fault either way (except for using unreadably small text in the first
place :-P)

I can try to file your friend's bug report but it would help if they
were willing to take a screenshot and then mark on it which bits they
find hard to read.  I don't have a Mac, and even if I did, I'd be
guessing ...
