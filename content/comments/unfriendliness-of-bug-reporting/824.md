When I saw the title of this post I thought it might be about
project-independent web app UI, one reason people give for switching
from Bugzilla to Trac, Jira, FogBugz, and other tools.  But it sounds
like the root of the UI confusion is the natural cruft and confusion
of a long-standing development project that's changed its processes &
architecture without a wholesale revamping of its bug reporting.  Your
wizard-ish suggestion sounds like a good solution, and the process of
creating it would probably get other important decisions made along
the way (priorities, architecture, workflow, etc.).
