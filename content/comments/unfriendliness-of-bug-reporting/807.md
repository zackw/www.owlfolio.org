So, you mention this whole non-scalable solution thing, eh?  A friend
just made the following grumpy post, which perhaps you can file
appropriately, please?  :)

"I just upgraded to Firefox 3 and I really really wish they would get
feedback from people with worse than 20/20 vision before they take
them out of beta. I appreciate that they want the Mac version to mesh
with the Mac aesthetic, but come on, people! Dark gray background with
small darker gray text on all the tabs? Brushed metal is just not very
readable. Contrast is good, people. And the text is too small! I don't
want icons in the tabs- I want bigger text. Or I want to be able to
choose.

"And page zoom is a neat idea. It kind of makes more sense than text
zoom. But it's obviously not designed with people who use text zoom
regularly in mind. Page zoom ends up pushing things out side-to-side
so you need to scroll side-to-side to read text. I'd gotten used to
the formatting being all funky and broken when I zoom the text, but I
really don't want to have to scroll for every line."

I think someone did suggest how to get a different theme than the
gray-on-gray, but is the text zoom thing possible?

Anyway, I hope your suggestions for Bugzilla get some concrete
results!
