The one thing I hate above all else is having to create an
account. Really, if you're serious about quality then you shouldn't
give a \*\*\*\* who the data comes from. If I'm frustrated enough with the
quality of your software to report a bug and you put obstacles in the
way of me doing that then I'm going to go to my fave search engine and
find an alternative product instead.
