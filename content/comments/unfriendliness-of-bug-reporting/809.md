Hi! I'm glad to see this sort of info written out. You'll be happy to
hear we're working on this. We've even gotten a group of HCI students
to start working on the UI as well! So... if you happen to be in the
Pittsburgh PA area, let me know, maybe they could do a usability study
with you. Otherwise, stay tuned and you're sure to hear and see much
more about the UI improvements we've got in store for Bugzilla!
