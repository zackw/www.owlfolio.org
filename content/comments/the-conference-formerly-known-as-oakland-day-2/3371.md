Regarding the Scalable Fault Localization paper, the part you were a
little confused about is basically a variation of the TESLA protocol.
In TESLA, you create a MAC on your packets and send them, then
disclose the key used for the MAC later, using time-asymmetry to give
you nice properties.  Here, you're getting similar time-asymmetry by
taking some action that is binding, then create a report based on some
subset of your past actions using a key that nobody knew when they
took the actions.  I was sort of involved in this paper, so I can
answer questions if you have them.
