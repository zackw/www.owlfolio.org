I remember playing PMOG for a while, in fact, until the extension
stopped working.  I will definitely check out Nova Initia.  I think
you're right about that specific class of games (shall we call them
"annotated reality"?) not supporting pay-to-play.  More, er,
secondary-world games do seem to be financially successful on the
"freemium" model (e.g. <a href="http://www.kingdomofloathing.com/"
rel="nofollow">Kingdom of Loathing</a>, <a
href="http://fallenlondon.storynexus.com/" rel="nofollow">Fallen
London</a>) but the ones I know about have much lower staff and
resource requirements than Glitch did (which ties into your analogy to
community rec centers).  Tiny Speck may have fallen victim to their
own ambition as much as anything else.

I actually still play original SNES cartridges on original hardware,
but only because my SO happened to keep hers around and in working
condition.
