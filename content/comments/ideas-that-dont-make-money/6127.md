I liked this post, but I don't really have anything to say.  Is this kind of feedback useful?

<blockquote>Free software helps, but not enough, because itâ€™s not
enough to be in possession of all the code</blockquote>

Though this part does remind me of the recent article on LWN, <a

rel="nofollow">Crowding out OpenBSD</a>, which has a similar theme to
the one you glance in your quote above.
