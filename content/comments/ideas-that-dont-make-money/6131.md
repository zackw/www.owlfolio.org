I appreciate knowing that I'm not just talking into a vacuum, at least.

Unfortunately I'm not an LWN subscriber and your link is not working
for me (possibly because I'm on dodgy hotel internets right now) but I
will look at it when I can.

I've also worked on conventional (directly installed on your computer)
free software projects which withered for lack of interest and other
tools crowding out the problem space.  There, at least, because the
code <i>is</i> the whole of the thing, it would not be hard to dust
them off if interest reappeared.
