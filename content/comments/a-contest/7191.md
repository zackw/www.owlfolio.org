I guess <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagbard_Celine"
rel="nofollow">Hagbard Celine</a> is a funny guy to get a citation
from (citation [13]), considering he was created for a book written as
early as 1975 (and thus way before the internet), with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Illuminatus!_Trilogy"
rel="nofollow">the book itself</a> having an interesting take on
conspiracy theories (according to wikipedia, I haven't read the book).
