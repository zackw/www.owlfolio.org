Wimpy low contreast fonts in text entry boxex are hard for me to
see. (Microsoft provided no robust fixed width font in my computer.)
Could a sender who has a lot of elderly chients send to them with an
embedded font that would be retter for their eyes so when they use his
system to reply he cab see what he writes?  ( I can barely see what I
akm typing because it is tiny and pale compared to the rest of the
page.  Can't see my typos.
