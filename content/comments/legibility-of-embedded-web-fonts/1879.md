I think that font is barely legible on any platform.

This web fonts trend is going to be a bloody disaster of crapple
fanboy designers trying to make websites look like print media as
they've always wanted to do but thank hell they haven't been able to.

Just when web accessibility and usability was getting fairly mature,
along comes a graphic designers wet dream and a user's worst
nightmare.

Why can't web authors learn from the mistakes of the past? First there
was animated gifs and blink tags, then DHTML abuses, then Flash and
now just when Flash is starting to take a back seat, we have yet
another new facility for designers to abuse user eyeballs: web fonts.

Is there a way to disable web fonts yet? If not I'm betting there will be one very soon.
