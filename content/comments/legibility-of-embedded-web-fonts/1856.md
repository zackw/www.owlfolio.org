Saying Linux is a bit oversimplifying.  Any given linux distro may or
may not be using the portions of TTF that
[require paying Apple for a license]; your Linux is probably avoiding
[them].  That's hardly their fault :)

You might recognise this screenshot from the hacks.mozilla.org testcase.

Anyway, as you can see. Not all fonts look horrible on Linux. Some
look worse on OSX ;)
