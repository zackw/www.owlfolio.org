    about:config
    gfx.downloadable_fonts.enabled=false

as noted previously.

NoScript also filters them by default due to higher possibility of
vulnerabilities.

I do think web fonts are pretty cool, since it prevents images of
text, one of those banes of the web and stupid flash hacks like sifr.
It also avoids designers designing for a font that only existed on
their OSX box, and pages looking completely different on other
computers, including hidden text or pushed down elements.  Another
nice thing for downloadable fonts, is they can be used for loading
single colour vector art into a site, icons and such, with more
reusability and flexibility.
