<blockquote>...each of these attacks requires the user to first visit
a malicious site, which is pretty rare, and then to interact with it
in a pretty extensive way, which is even rarer.</blockquote>

Right, that's why I said I was more concerned with similar attacks on
higher-value information.  You only need to steal a few AWS secret
keys to make it worth the trouble.

<blockquote>...the incidence of such visits (by the range of people
Iâ€™m familiar with) has been decreasing gradually over time as their
online experience grows. (It would be wonderful to get some data to
find out if this is generally the case.)</blockquote>

Off the top of my head, I don't see how to do that study in an ethical
way, but if you have ideas, I'd love to hear them.

<blockquote>ALL user-specific 3rd party information should be blocked
by default!</blockquote>

The trouble is doing that without breaking the Web ... my bank's
website, for instance, breaks horribly with third-party cookies
disabled, and they will not be persuaded to change it (I've tried).

I am increasingly of the opinion that everything, even images, should
require an opt-in in the HTTP headers to be loadable cross-domain, but
we'd need a time machine to change that one.
