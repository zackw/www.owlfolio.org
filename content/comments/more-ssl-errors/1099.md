Just a note: what you observed with mail.google.com most likely wasn't
a misconfiguration. You have to remember that it isn't one physical
server. There was probably a certificate update in progress. Depending
on which physical server you connected to you could get the old
certificate or the new one.

But I still agree with the essence: SSL is very hard to deal with and
many people get it wrong. Not to mention that there are many exotic
configurations (like people who somehow managed to disable some root
certificates - yet aren't aware of that).
