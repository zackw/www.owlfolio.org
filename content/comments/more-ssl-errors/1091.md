First of all, don't let people use self-signed. Really, just
don't. Their is no need for that.

Get a free domain-validated domain from: http://www.startssl.com/ it
doesn't take a lot of time and it's free and works with most
browsers*.

*Only Opera doesn't recognise it; Chrome, IE and Safari on Windows do
 with a not-so-recent Windows update; Firefox and Linux-distributions
 have it build-in.

Atleast some of the Bugzilla's I've seen are using
http://www.cacert.org/ so just one root-certificate-install to handle
many.

Also I have the feeling the 'problem' with the servers of Google is,
they have many servers and your browser is the only visiting different
servers and Google does not change them all in a jiffy.
