Yes MITM happens, but it's not exactly common. The Perspectives
extension is one better way to handle it.

Encryption without authentication is not useless, far less valuable,
but not useless. As long as I continue to see the same cert, I don't
need anyone else to 'authenticate' my site for me! The same goes for
the internal site I setup for work. When I tell people "this is our
intranet web site", I am vouching for the authenticity of the site. No
one else need get involved.

If I can be certain that the Amazon.com website is presenting me with
the same cert it has presented me with the last 50 times I went there,
I can be reasonably confident that it is the real Amazon.com. If I
know other people elsewhere are seeing the same cert I can be even
more confident.
