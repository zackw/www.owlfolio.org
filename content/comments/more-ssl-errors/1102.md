Please stop treating self signed certs as worse than no security! I
still can not understand why Mozilla treats a small increase in
security as if it were a massive decrease. Give self signed certs
equal status as no security.

<blockquote>First of all, don’t let people use self-signed. Really,
just don’t. Their is no need for that.</blockquote>

You may not have a need but I do.  This stubborn insistence on forcing
encryption to be locked with identity verification has crippled the
use of encryption on the web. Yes I understand the importance of the
combination, but SSH handles the problem properly. The Perspectives
extension takes the SSH model and adds another level of protection.

SSL certs are too much of a pain to get, setup and maintain. Small
admin mistakes cause scary looking errors for end users, often when no
actual problem exists.

If I use a self signed cert on my own website, I know I can trust it,
I don't need someone else to vouch for me! I can handle adding the
cert in my browser, but my Wife and family get freaked out and the end
result is we must teach them to ignore the error, or not use
encryption. Not exactly the ideal outcome.
