I actually <em>like</em> the dialog popping up - it proves to me it's
a chrome prompt and not a web page pretending to be one.  As an aside:
I tried to expand your "current warning screen" example, because I
totally thought it was a real error page!

I wish there were some way I can tell the browser to load the page
without trusting it - perhaps I want to see a CACert-signed bugzilla,
but I don't want to actually let it do things like handle extension
updates.  Current even the non-permanent exception still applies all
over the app, and not just per-tab.

Sadly, I do get MITMed often - when my ADSL modem disconnects, it
tries to redirect all http and https requests to its configuration
page to try to get me to hit connect.  Except that it's using
self-signed cert for the wrong domain... bah.
