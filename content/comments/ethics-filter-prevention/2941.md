And as a follow-up to what Justin said: if Arishat, Brutus and Cato
are from three different countries, which court(s) shall judge the
case? And (considering the laws and customs about extradition, where
most countries are reluctant to extradite their nationals), if a
single case is tried in Arisha's country in favour of Arisha, in
Brutus's country in favour of Brutus, and in Cato's country in favour
of Cato, what will happen then?

BTW, I may trust the Belgian courts (i.e. the courts of my country),
but I'm far from certain that I would trust a US court in a case
between me and, hm, let's say Microsoft or Google.
