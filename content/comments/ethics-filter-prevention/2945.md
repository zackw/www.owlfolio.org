I tend to think the "instructions for constructing something very
dangerous" scenario is overblown.  There is no equivalent in
microbiology for the turnkey exploits that we're used to in computer
security.  I know people who do "DIY genetic engineering" in their
kitchens; it requires a nontrivial investment in equipment, a bunch of
background knowledge to even know what the instructions mean, and a
fair bit of practice to make anything interesting happen.  Right now,
I may be being overoptimistic about the goodwill of microbiologists
worldwide toward humanity in general, but I think that anyone who
<i>wanted</i> to make a deadly, contagious virus probably couldn't do
anything with the instructions even if they had them, and anyone who
has the skill and the equipment to do something with the instructions
probably doesn't want to.

Now, if we ever get <i>Diamond Age</i> style matter compilers, this
will become a much more serious issue---but at that point I would
advocate that it is hopeless to try to police the use of the devices,
and we should work instead toward a society where no one is so
disgruntled that they want to take out a city.
