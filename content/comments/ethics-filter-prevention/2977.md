I believe that the set of "inputs" that are <i>intrinsically
harmful</i> to the development of moral character is either
nonexistent or so small as to be negligible.

What harms said development, in my view, is mostly restricting one's
reading/watching/hearing to a limited range of perspectives, or
<i>uncritical</i> consumption of any particular item; and the critical
eye is itself best developed by exposure to a wide range of content.
Therefore, I'm primarily concerned with the <i>breadth</i> of what my
hypothetical child takes in, rather than any particular thing it may
or may not contain, and I mean to make a point of discussing
everything with them.

Could you give some examples of material that you would consider
intrinsically harmful to children's moral development?
