I'm the opposite; I find the Arishat scenarios more interesting, and I
can't at present think of <i>any</i> scenarios where I would support
Cato over Brutus, which is why the only principle in my list for Cato
vs Brutus online is basically that Brutus wins.

Even in the parent/child case, the furthest I would ever go with my
own (hypothetical) child is "That book will make more sense to you
when you're older.  If you really want to read it now, you can try,
and I'll try to explain anything that doesn't make sense, but I may
not be able to make it make sense."  Or perhaps "No, you may not watch
that scary movie right now, because you have school tomorrow, and the
last time you watched a scary movie you didn't get any sleep the night
afterward.  Maybe on the weekend."  I have a good deal of faith in my
hypothetical children's ability to handle stuff, I guess.

I'd be interested to hear Cato/Brutus scenarios that <i>you</i> think
are interesting, though.  It is quite possible that I am missing
something important.
