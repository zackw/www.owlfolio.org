I have read <i>Longitude</i>, but I might've used that example even if
I hadn't; I was taken to tour the Royal Observatory in Greenwich at an
impressionable age.  They have all of Harrison's chronometers on
display.

Text handling might have been a better example, because it's easy to
illustrate that Unicode is full of unnecessary junk but remains
inconveniently complicated even if you take all of that out.  (The
bidi algorithm, for instance, ain't going anywhere.)
