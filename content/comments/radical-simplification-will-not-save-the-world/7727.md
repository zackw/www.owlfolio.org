This is a list, with reviews, of suggested books, periodicals,
television shows and computer programs for a classroom curriculum or
individual study in cybernetics and systems theory. It does not (yet)
include a course plan, glossary, or extended bibliography. I was asked
to write this by some teachers who received a copy of class notes I
prepared for a course in "Understanding Whole Systems" sixteen years
ago at the University of California at Santa Cruz. They asked how I
would revise it based on what I know today. This document answers that
question.
