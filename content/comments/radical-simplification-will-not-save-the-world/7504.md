What is your take on Rust, and the plan to rewrite FF using Rust?  It
seems like it would be a very painful transition, ala the netscape
rewrite that produced mozilla after a three+ year rewrite. Or is there
something different about that plan that doesn't fall foul of the
principals you are talking about here?
