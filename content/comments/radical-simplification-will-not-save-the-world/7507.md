Do I guess correctly that you've read Dava Sobel's book "Longitude" at
some point?  I'd have provided an estimate as to what Â£20000 would be
worth in today's terms (on the order of several million dollars), tho,
for a little more clarity (setting aside, of course, the utter
incomparability of purchasing power of then to now).
