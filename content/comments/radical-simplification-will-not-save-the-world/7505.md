This critique doesn't apply at all to Rust / Servo, because they
aren't trying to make everything as simple as possible.  My
understanding is that the goal for Rust is to be highly
<i>expressive</i> and to provide certain safety guarantees that C++
doesn't (such as type-theoretic soundness), and the goal for Servo is
to explore algorithmic improvements to the browser engine that would
be very difficult to code reliably in C++ (such as parallelized
layout).

On an organizational level, Servo certainly <i>could</i> wind up being
a painful transition, but at present it's just a technology demo and
doesn't seem to be sucking resources away from the existing codebase,
so I think worrying about that is premature.
