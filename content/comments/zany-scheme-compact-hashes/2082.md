<blockquote>It’s an interesting idea, but it falls flat if the
file/stream uses an encoding, like Windows-1252 (sometimes called
“ANSI”, often mistaken for ISO-8859-1), which lacks one or more of
scripts you chose.</blockquote>

Indeed, there is no legacy encoding that contains all of the
characters I listed.  You have to encode documents that use this
scheme in UTF-8.  That is 100% fine by me.  I'm much more concerned
about people not having convenient access to <i>fonts</i> that include
all these characters; reading this post on my smartphone, all the
Armenian letters were replaced with little boxes.

I haven't decided how serious I am about this scheme --- that's why I
called it a zany scheme --- but the goal is to be <i>more</i> compact
than base64 in terms of space taken up on screen.  Also, yes, "+",
"/", and "=" are troublesome in URIs (especially "/").  <i>Every</i>
ASCII punctuation character is assigned meaning by some spec relevant
to the web.  (The least troublesome characters are &ldquo;-&rdquo;,
"_", and ".".  I wish base64 had used those instead.)
