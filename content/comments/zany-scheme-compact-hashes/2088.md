It's tempting, but I'm having enough trouble finding 256 characters
that are sufficiently visually distinct and are all included in one
monospace font that everyone has.  Also, right-to-left alphabets
cannot be used for this, so I very much doubt I could get 4096
letter-like symbols without resorting to CJK ideographs (which take up
2 columns per glyph, defeating the purpose).

There is no mathematical guarantee that two different documents won't
hash to <i>nearly</i> the same fingerprint.  (You may be thinking of
the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect"
rel="nofollow">avalanche effect</a>" which is about <i>small</i>
changes to the input.)
