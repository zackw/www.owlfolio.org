why stop there? if your goal is "display compactness", why not encode
12 (or even more) bits per character? i am sure you can easily find
4096 "letter-like" symbols in unicode.

and i don't think you need to be careful when choosing characters, for
example to ensure that they don't look alike. hashes don't ever differ
in a single character or two, they always differ in <i>all</i>
characters, so you can easily visually compare two hashes, even when
<i>some</i> of the characters might be confused.
