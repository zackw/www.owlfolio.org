It's an interesting idea, but it falls flat if the file/stream uses an
encoding, like Windows-1252 (sometimes called "ANSI", often mistaken
for ISO-8859-1), which lacks one or more of scripts you chose.

There just isn't space for 256 printable characters in any single-byte
encoding, and I'm not even sure all the multi-bytes include them all.

Given the history of character encoding, you're probably really only
safe selecting characters from the mother-of-all-fallbacks,
US-ASCII. I can't recall encountering a single encoding in the real
world that doesn't include ASCII while I can think of several off the
top of my head that lack Cyrillic.

It only has 90-something printable characters (and you won't want to
use a bunch of those), but you can still beat hex for density.

In fact, unless there's a reason not to use "+" or "/" how about
Base64? It's well-known, simple, and gets you 6 bits per character, so
the hashes would be a hair over 2/3 as long as hex representations.
