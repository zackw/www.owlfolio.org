well, "there is no mathematical guarantee that two different documents
won't hash to <em>exactly</em> the same fingerprint" -- there is only
very high probability that it wont happen.

similarly, there is very high (slightly lower, but still very high)
probability that any documents you work with (in your lifetime) won't
hash to similar fingerprints..

(similar principle explains why Git can get away with only showing 7
characters of the hash by default in many places -- not that there are
no objects with equal first 7 chars, only the probability of two being
in the same project/branch/revision is miniscule)
