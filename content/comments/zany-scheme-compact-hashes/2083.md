I think there are plenty of usable characters in the range you want
such that you still avoid accents and punctuation and right-to-left
and a bunch of other wierd things.  In particular, using the
(intentionally old) Unicode 4.0 database, if I run:

    head -2040 unicode/4.0/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt |
        grep "^0[0-7]" | grep -v '' | grep -v " WITH " |
        grep -v "MODIFIER LETTER " | grep -v "COMBINING " |
        grep -v "SPACING " | grep -v "LIGATURE" |
        grep -v "\(ARABIC\|HEBREW\|SYRIAC\|THAANA\)" |
        cut -d\; -f1-3 | grep "\(N\|L\).$"

(the very last bit limits it to numeric and letter character classes),
I get 506 available characters.

Now there's a bunch in there I'd avoid, but I think there's still
plenty.  In particular, if you need 256, I'd suggest maybe picking
from the following list of 300 (as unicode ranges, in hex): 30-39,
41-5a, 61-7a,c6,d0,de,de,df,e6,f0,fe,391-3a9,3b1-3c9,3e2-3ef,401-45f
(maybe exclude some of those), 531-556,561-586.
