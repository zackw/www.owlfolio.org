I agree it may have been the best choice 15 years ago. And I haven't
been around for that long.

But now 15 year later, we have C99, C++11 and POSIX. It's time to let
the past be past and move on to the future ;-)

Today these old remnants are slowing down progress, and having worked
on a few cleanups in widget/ I know what a pain os/2 and beos are and
I will be happy to see them removed.
