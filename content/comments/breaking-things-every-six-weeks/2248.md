Very soundly argued blog post, probably the best I've seen on the
topic. Another thing you might want to mention is that addon
developers who embrace the rapid release cycle will be able to drop
backwards compatibility and release new versions of their addons for
new versions of Firefox / Thunderbird only. Having tried it, it's
actually pretty awesome.
