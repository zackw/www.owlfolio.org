"...without extensions there is not much reason to pick one browser
over another."

Extensions are mostly for power-users. Most users don't even know or
care about extensions.

Really, what bothers most users about updates are big interface
changes and additional features which they have to evaluate and get
used to. Even the good intentioned Mozilla Foundation might make
changes that users don't agree with. As long as the changes are
evolutionary and not revolutionary most users won't have a problem.
Fixes for speed, stability and compatibility are safe bets.

Firefox has been increasingly imposing UI changes and features on
users.  The transition from Firefox 1 to Firefox 2 was okay but both
Firefox 3 and Firefox 4 imposed some changes on users that kept them
from upgrading until website compatibility forced them to.
