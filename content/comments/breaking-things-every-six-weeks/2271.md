I don't think it matters to my point whether the entity was called
Netscape, Mozilla Foundation, or Mozilla Corporation; the constant
here is that external groups - and over the last decade or so there
has been a few - have not been able to become central enough to the
project.

I think we disagree on what the Mozilla <em>project</em> is. I think
you're counting the people you currently know about contributing, and
I'm thinking about various people who have tried to contributed.

Anyway, I see a post in .planning that looks interesting...
