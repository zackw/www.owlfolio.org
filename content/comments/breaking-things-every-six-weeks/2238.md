I disagree that any of XUL, XBL, XPConnect, XPCOM, NSPR, even mork,
were anything like bad ideas. In fact, some of those were absolutely
brilliant, and we are still striving to make standard web technologies
match the power of some of those, esp. XUL and XBL - and still have a
number of miles to go on our way there. Of course, we might be been
going too far or gone along some bad paths in XPCOM and using RDF, but
that doesn't make them bad ideas altogether. some of those were
awesome steps in enabling compatibility cross-platform and
-language. But, as you mention, a lot of those technologies are more
than 12-13 years old and might not be completely in line with current
practices or platforms any more - and I agree that we can and need to
improve to match up better again.

Let's not focus on making the past look like we messed up, let's focus
on learning from what was good and bad and improving the future. Let's
not focus on breaking things, let's focus on enabling. Let's not focus
on how we suck, but how we can rock.

At Mozilla, we're not moaning the past, we're taking advantage of
knowing about it today to build the future.
