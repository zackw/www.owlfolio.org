You really don't understand how wrong you are.

The cross platform nature of the Netscape code (including NSPR)
allowed us to port it to OS/2 with incredible ease. The focus back
then was on cross platform (as was already pointed out). It was even
ported to BeOS.

It's easy to look at things now and say they were bad decisions, but
unless you were there involved in making the decisions, you don't have
a clue.

You do realize these technology decisions were made 15 years ago,
right? The world was a very different place.
