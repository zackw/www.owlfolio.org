Dude, have you <i>seen</i> what a mork file looks like? ;-)

But seriously ... I'll grant that we don't have a good replacement for
XUL, XBL, XPConnect, XPCOM, NSS, or NSPR right now.  I'll even grant
that you can currently do things with some of them that you can't do
with anything else.  That doesn't make any of them <i>good
designs</i>, and in particular I stand on the assertion that XPCOM has
always been a Bad Thing and should have been recognized as such on day
one.  Something <i>like</i> NSPR was needed back in the 1990s, as the
Unix wars raged, but it is horribly overdesigned for what it does
(count the number of abstractions you go through to get from
PR_Listen() to listen() some time), and the need for it is much
reduced now.

We can't learn from our mistakes if we don't acknowledge that they
were mistakes.
