Part of the problem with extension breakages is a "do as we say not as
we do" sort of thing. For the web, we tell people to check for
features and not individual browsers and versions. With extensions, we
can do nothing but check for individual browsers and versions. AMO's
plan of running a compatibility check on addons and remotely bumping
max versions if possible is a start, but one of these days we really
need a way for that to be done automatically and reliably in the
client.

Oh, and binary components need to go away entirely. Aside from their
problems they just can't keep up with needing to be re-compiled for
every major version. This keeps coming up in discussions but as of yet
no one has made the decision to pull the trigger and begin phasing
support for them out.
