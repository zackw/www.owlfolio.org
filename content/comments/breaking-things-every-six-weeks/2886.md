So, the love for software candy, i.e. "rapid release" is going to HELP
create an environment of dependable long-term software standards for
the web? It's going to improve the existence of strong QA test
barriers? NOT! It's no longer do-it-right-the-first-time now it's fix
it as you go, tweak it as you go, change it for no reason, wow, what
"progress."
