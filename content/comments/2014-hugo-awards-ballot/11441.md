<blockquote>Charles Stross is pretty awesome. You read the latest
Laundry Novel : The Rhesus Chart ?</blockquote>

I find Charles Stross to be of variable quality.  The Laundry series,
for instance, <i>seems</i> to have much less of an infodumpage problem
than <i>Neptune's Brood</i> did.  (Or he might just be better at
blending it in there.)  Contrariwise, I threw the first Merchant
Princes book across the room.

I'm 2 books behind on the Laundry but will get to them eventually.

For complicated personal reasons having very little to do with the
content or quality of his novels, I probably won't ever read another
book of his. I don't want to talk about it.
