fwiw I'm on the last book of the Wheel of Time, and I am enjoying it
far far more than I ever did the LoTR.

The first book did have a LOT of whiney/boring points. But the further
books have a lot more character exposition, less whine and more actual
adventure. Plus a pretty grand breadth of characters and depth of each
individual character, unlike any multi-novel book series I've read
yet.

I'd be interested in a summation of your thoughts once you complete
Book 3 or 4
