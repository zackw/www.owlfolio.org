Thanks for the informative write-up! I'll have to do some follow-up
investigation of a number of these.

And while I'm here, some differences of opinion: Pacific Rim is awful,
just awful. Stupid, implausible, macho, long, boring.

And Frozen arguably does break some new ground (certainly for a Disney
movie) with an excellent twist on the old "magical illness needs to be
cured with an act of true love" trope. And "Let It Go" is a pretty
amazing song.
