I meant $v$ (and $0$) in there to be the constants of integration
(while at the same time trying not to mention constants of
integration, on the theory that it would just add confusion).  Now I
look at it harder, that would come out not <em>quite</em> the same
thing as what I wrote---but not quite the same as what you wrote
either.  The acceleration only kicks in at time $t = 0$, so a more
precise formulation would be

$$ \nu(t) = \begin{cases}
   v               & \text{if}\: t < 0 \\\\
   v + A(t) - A(0) & \text{if}\: t \ge 0
   \end{cases}
$$

where $A = \int a\, \text{d}t = at + C$, and we set $C = 0
\Leftrightarrow A(0) = 0$. Similarly for the position function.  I
think what I'll do is move the $v +$ and $0 +$ outside the integrals
to make it clearer that those are boundary conditions.
