I would use conservation of energy. The change in kinetic energy from
stopping the object is equal to the work done on it:

$$\begin{aligned}
\frac{1}{2}m(0^2 - v^2) =& Fd = mad \\
-\frac{1}{2}v^2 =& ad \\
a =&\displaystyle \frac{-v^2}{2d}
\end{aligned}$$

The formula Neil gave is the special case of conservation of energy
when dealing with a constant force (and it's roughly equivalent to the
middle formula here).

Using conservation of energy is quicker for problems like these where
you just need to know about the state of object at one point
(e.g. where it stops). However, you don't get the full trajectory
function ($x(t)$) that you found.

Actually, there is a whole alternative formulation of classical
mechanics that doesn't use Newton's Laws or forces at all, called <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics"
>Lagrangian mechanics</a>. You just write down the
formulas for all the energy in the system, apply a differential
equation, and you almost magically get a equation to solve for your
trajectory (warning: lots of heavy math in that article).
