It's great to see a Mozillian using MathJax (and so our MathML
support)!  Just a minor comment: in the first equation, the second
member is not equal to the others. Obviously, you mean

$$ \nu(t) - v = \int_0^t a\; \text{d}t = at $$

instead. The same holds for the "0 +" in the second equation, but this
one does not change anything :-).
