Fairly minimal. You get to choose one of one to six higher-powered
'Big Shots,' and anywhere from two to four units depending on the
scenario out of 4-8 (depending on how many you've unlocked and what
town you're in), and that's all your unit selection. Units can pick up
bonuses randomly generated across the map in-game to improve in one
aspect for that scenario (until they die and respawn), and you can
bring up to three cards in that let you use special effects or give
out those bonuses deliberately... But the strategy is all in how you
use the units you chose, and maybe the cards, on a given combination
of map and scenario and how the other players are acting.

While it's quite strategic, it's maybe more on the wargame than
roguelike side of things: it's all about out-manuevering the other
players while working towards various goals. (Each scenario has a set
goal that's worth the most points, but you also get points for damage
done and bonuses picked up, so you can lose at the main goal and still
win the scenario if you're tricky.)
