Bang! Howdy works like that; you always hit (unless someone's played a
specific card on you), you do damage proportional to how much health
you have yet based on your unit's particular bonuses or penalties
against another unit... It's very tactical, which is probably why I'm
lousy at it. But with tick-based combat, it really is good to avoid
the frustration of carefully setting up an attack or defense and then
failing because of the luck of the dice.
