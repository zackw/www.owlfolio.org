It's either. In a roguelike, is there enough else that you can do to
gain or lose advantage? Most don't really have cover, or flanking
bonuses, or etc etc. I love zero randomness games- I really should
give Diplomacy a shot- but most RPGs I'm not sure how well it
fits. Depending on what you do, the choice between a high endcap but
high variance weapon and one with a smaller range but lower high end
is an interesting choice, and it vanishes if you always do full
damage. Stuff like that.
