Yeah.  And I don't think you could fit things like cover into a
roguelike without spoiling the interface...  You might be able to mess
around with weapon effectiveness versus different monsters, but that
probably just leads to characters walking around carrying five zillion
weapons, rather like Nobbs in <i>Men at Arms</i>.  And Nethack's
entire luck mechanic goes right out the window in a zero randomness
context.

It may work for You Only Live Once just because it's so short and
simple; I have the impression there isn't much of an equipment
optimization game in there.  I should actually try playing it.
