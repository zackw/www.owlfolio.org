I'm sorry about the bad formatting.  This site now uses WordPress, so
comment behavior should be much more normal.  I've taken the liberty
of deleting one copy of your comment.

It's true that I don't follow more than a handful of people by Twitter
standards, and I know exactly who they all are and why they're there.
I don't mean to say that you should stop listing any of the people who
come up in my report!  Rather, what I was thinking is that you could
have <i>more</i> categories in the report.  "Follows nobody" and
"Never posts at all" seem like useful behaviors to distinguish from
their parent categories, especially.
