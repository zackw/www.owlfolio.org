I am both a reader of your blog through Planet and a Planet Module
peer (a member of the governance structure for Planet Mozilla.)  I
appreciate the wide variety of content that you and others syndicate
to Planet.  It helps us fulfill Planet's mission of showcasing the
human beings of Mozilla and not just the work product of Mozilla.

If you and others syndicate less content we will know less about each
other and that's a regression in my opinion because Mozilla is more
than some lines of code and some websites. We're a global community of
people participating in a movement.

We are all about people. Our mission is to help people. Our products
are in service of people. We create change by organizing people. Our
forums should reflect that by showing that we are a diverse collection
of people with all variety of interests, lifestyles, genders,
nationalities, hobbies, and stories to tell.

Mozilla is more than "a job" and I hope that we can do more, not less,
to emphasize that.
