I suggesting including "Small programs that were a pain to write and
might be useful to someone else maybe someday" in case they are
technical in a way that might have Mozilla relevance and "Various
Internet-security-related topics which may or may not have anything to
do with The Web" on the grounds that Internet security is relevant to
Mozilla.

I don't really have a problem with your other topics even if notes
about giving away pottery in California is irrelevant to me, but in
the interest of keeping divisive political and religious topics off
the Planet, it's easier to say to <i>include</i> only Mozilla
(semi-)relevant technical stuff (or I guess Mozilla-relevant legal
stuff; consider SOPA) instead of saying that things X, Y and Z should
be <i>excluded</i>.

Alereon: The Planet owners/peers have encouraged non-filtering at the
source. See e.g. https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=502224
