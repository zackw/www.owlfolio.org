I think it's probably best if this decision is made on a
community-wide basis, and you send content appropriate for aggregator
policy. If there's an aggregator for "Mozilla participants feeds", as
Planet is now, I'd say send everything. If that aggregator policy
changes, or another one appears which is Mozilla-content-only, then,
just send Mozilla stuff.

I am personally happy to have everything in the above list in my feed reader.
