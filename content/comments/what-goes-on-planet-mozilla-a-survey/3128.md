I agree with Alereon and RNiK. It's quite clear that those who work
for/with Mozilla like the personal posts; for the rest of us however
they are irrelevant and mostly unwanted. I'm sure you can understand
that I don't care about your trip or your pottery classes because I
don't know you personally (and I don't need to); I can follow my own
friends on FB or twitter if I want to.

Asa: Do you want to hear about my recent trip to my parents and my
newborn?
