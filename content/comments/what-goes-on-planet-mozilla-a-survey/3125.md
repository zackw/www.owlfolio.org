I personally feel that the odd, non or loosely linked posts on planet
are good, and I don't mean by percentage of what is in your personal
blog, I mean overall. So I think it depends. If you are continually
posting, and they never have a link back to Mozilla, then maybe
filter, however I quite like to read about others on planet.

In short... I don't see the need for a filter in your case. I filter
mine, however for the most part my blog is just Mozilla related
content. Though when I do something completely unrelated I tend to
prefer to let that stay just on my blog and in the readers of my blog
(no planet).
