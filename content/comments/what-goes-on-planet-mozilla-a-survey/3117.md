For me: all of it, since they're all no less relevant (and some are
more interesting) to me than the Mozilla Journalism, HTML 5 games, and
whatever else posts.  I expect opinions to differ from mine on this
point.

But that's kind of the point - there's no need to move things around
until the planet module maintainers finish whatever is necessary to
fork out the on-topic feeds and the firehose feeds, so that people can
choose.
