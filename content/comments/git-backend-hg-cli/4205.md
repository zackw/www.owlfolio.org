I asked nenolod but he doesn't remember what it was and, if Chainsaw
still comes on, I haven't run into him.

Either way, it was a similar scenario to what Gregory Szorc described.
Mercurial trashed the repo badly enough that they had to re-clone and
manually copy over their changes.

Git's documentation could definitely use some work (and, ideally, a
really polished novice-to-expert tutorial that isn't still under
construction), but it really is excellent when it comes to keeping
"lost" data until you "git gc" in case you need to recover it.

The only time I've ever seen it "trash" a repo is when I've given it a
command that makes sense in some obscure use case but didn't do what I
thought it would... and then it did exactly what it was told and no
bugs in the code were involved.
