I don't remember exactly what they were doing and I don't think I was
logging channel content at the time, but I'll ask them if they
remember and get back to you.

I know it was something similar to what you've experienced with git
though. (Following their intuitions from another VCS and doing things
in a way experienced Mercurial users don't)

As for index/working, I started out with an attitude like yours. Now,
I use it the way it was intended:

1. I accidentally make more than one change without committing
2. I run `git gui`
3. I use the right mouse button to select which lines and hunks belong to each change
4. I make several separate, clean commits

(I keep `git gui` open on my second monitor. You can also run it in
"one commit, then exit" mode as `git citool`)

If you do want to ignore the index/working distinction, just set up an
alias like `co = commit -a` and run `git co` all the time. It's
mentioned in most tutorials.
