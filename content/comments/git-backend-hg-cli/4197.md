It's basically an attempt to build a repository class for git storage
that works with all of Mercurial's other code (i.e. the UI).

I think the problems with hg-git end up being that because of the way
the hashes are built up, you basically need a whole lot of state to be
able to talk to remote git repositories from your Mercurial repo, to
the point where it's just easier to keep a .git dir around, too. So
hgit is an attempt to just have the .git dir and replace all of the
code to implement Mercurial's storage with git storage equivalents
(based on dulwich, which AIUI is a pretty nice Python library for
this).
