I guess the difference is people working with the DAG in mind and
those that don't. I'm too very unsure about what git might be doing
when I enter the next command.

I'm not sure if it's possible to port mercurial over to the git
backend or vice versa, looking at some of the concepts behind git via
the GitPython lib, that sounded rather alien to what I'm used to
interfacing with the mercurial python code.
