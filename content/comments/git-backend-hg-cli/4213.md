As I say upthread, it's quite possible that the Git repositories I
gave up on <i>could have</i> been repaired without re-cloning, but I
don't consider that a point in Git's favor, because Mercurial never
puts me in that situation in the first place.  "Never" is not an
exaggeration.  I'd really, seriously like to know what you did to blow
up a Mercurial repo, because it just doesn't seem possible to me.
