Yes. In fact, I've gotten started on it, although I haven't gotten
very far yet. I have some C code and I even tried some stuff in Rust.

TBH, I'm not sure you can do an exact clone. Yes, I would get rid of
the index and staging and whatever, but I think you have to more or
less adopt the branching model (i.e. branches are just pointers to
changesets, outside of history) -- not that that's a bad thing, it
would just be different from Mercurial.

Anyway, once I get some further traction on this, I'll let you know.
