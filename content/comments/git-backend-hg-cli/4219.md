Hitting ctrl-C during various operations has corrupted my repo in the
past, forcing me to reclone.

The git interface seems overly complex to me, but I don't think one
can avoid learning git these days, so it makes sense for everyone to
standardize on git as *the* DVCS until/unless something fundamentally
better comes along.
