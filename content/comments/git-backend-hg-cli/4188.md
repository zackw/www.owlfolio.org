<q>... you more or less have to adopt the branching model ...</q>

This worries me.  I don't know <i>why</i> git keeps mangling my
repositories, but I know it has something to do with branches, because
it never happens as long as the history is perfectly linear and I
don't need to go back in time.  I believe my problem is with the CLI
rather than the data model, but I could be wrong!

Anyhow, I shall be very interested to hear what comes of your project,
and if there's anything I can do to help (given my extremely limited
time) please let me know.
