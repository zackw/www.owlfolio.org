The DAG is <i>conceptually</i> the same between mercurial and git,
though.  The only difference I know of is that mercurial revisions are
indelibly tagged with their branch of origin while git revisions
aren't, and it <i>seems</i> like that shouldn't be a big deal.  A
minor point in mercurial's favor when you need to do archaeology,
perhaps.
