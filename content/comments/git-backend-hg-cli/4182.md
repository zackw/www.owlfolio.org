Ironically, I feel almost an exact mirror of your pain.

I saw a lot of cursing over mercurial mangling repositories during my
time lurking in the Audacious Media Player development channel, so
I'll never trust it with my data. (They've since moved to Git)

I can't live without the index/working copy distinction.

Every now and then, I go looking to see if anyone's written a
Mercurial-focused analogue to git-svn.
