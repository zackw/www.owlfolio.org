I've been hacking on hg-git the last few weekends to make it
faster. As part of my work, I've been trying to factor out things into
a generic library (one that isn't so tightly coupled with being a
Mercurial extension). Hopefully the end result could be used to power
a frontend like you desire.

From a technical perspective, using Git as the sole backend for
Mercurial should be doable. Git supports arbitrary metadata in commit
objects. So, everything you store in Mercurial can be captured by
Git. There may be some rewriting going on, but that would all be
transparent to the driver. The only incompatible difference between
their storage models is that Git supports N&gt;2 parents on a commit
(an octopus merge) whereas Mercurial only supports up to 2
parents. Also, Mercurial does store per-file history. So, some
file-level query operations would not translate well to Git at the API
level.

While I'm here, I will weigh in that I've had Mercurial destroy
repository data multiple times, forcing me to re-clone. I've never had
a Git repo get so corrupted that I couldn't dig myself out from
looking at the reflogs combined with `git reset --hard`. Git is
actually very good about not throwing away data. I will admit that the
tooling for recovery when you shoot yourself in the foot could be
better.
