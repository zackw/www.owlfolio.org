The SSL error screens post is several months old - I switched the site
to Wordpress and it spammed Planet Mozilla :( That's why comments are
disabled.  I'll probably do a follow-up later today, I got some email
responses too.

The short answer to your question is that that's not a fully-baked
thing that we're definitely going to do, it's just me making stuff up.
I like your idea, but it might be unpleasantly hard to implement,
because those error screens don't have the power to do anything a
regular webpage can't do (for good reason).
