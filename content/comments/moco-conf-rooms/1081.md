There is no 'p' in '[hamster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamster)',
but there is definitely a 'p' in
'[hampster dance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hampster_Dance)'.
I see that the site I linked to has had the spelling 'corrected',
alas.

The second floor 'K' conference room appears to have become
'[kiss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)' since I was last
here.
