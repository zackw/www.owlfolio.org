"It takes only a couple sentences to state that your story is set in
the distant future Imperium of Man, in which women and men alike may
serve in any position in the military and are considered completely
equal; it takes constant vigilance over the course of the entire novel
to make sure that you donâ€™t have the men in the Imperial Marines
taking extra risks to protect from enemy fire those of their fellow
grunts who happen to be women."

Nicely said.
