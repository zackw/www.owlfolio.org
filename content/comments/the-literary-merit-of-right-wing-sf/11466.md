This question, and many like it regarding discrimination against the
right-wing politics (e.g., in writing, in academia, etc.) embrace and
assume a moral and intellectual relativism. The assumption is: 1)
Because left and right-wing ideas are associated with different parts
of the political spectrum, and 2) because a value in our society is to
tolerate differing political viewpoints, then 3) left-wing and
right-wing ideas are intellectually and morally (and otherwise)
equivalent.

The right-wing uses this to claim equivalent merit for many ideas
which are inferior. But #3 doesn't follow from #1 and #2. Climate
change denial is not intellectually and morally equal to climate
science. Racial discrimination and white power are not morally and
intellectually equal to civil rights and tolerance. (Yes, there are
right-wing ideas that are superior. But IMHO, the right's standards
are low, especially when their only standards are the assumption
described above or tradition, and it results in an inferior body of
ideas.)

Who is to say what idea is superior? Yes, there is no absolute
authority who can make pronouncements, but again, the lack of a
definitive answer doesn't make the ideas equivalent.
