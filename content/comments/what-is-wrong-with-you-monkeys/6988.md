The guys didn't make jokes about her or about women in general as far
as I know.  Instead of asking this 2 guys to shut up she posted the
picture from this 2 guys on twitter.  Sorry but that is a no-go and
she should knew it better as PR person.  After the poor guy with 3
kids lost his job I'm glad the she also lost her job. Maybe she and
the community will learn from this.

Note: My opinion would be different if someone makes racist jokes or
jokes against women.
