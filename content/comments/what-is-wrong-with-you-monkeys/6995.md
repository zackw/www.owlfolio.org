I am not a straight white male. I have a somewhat prominent online
persona, in that news sites mention my name in their stories, and
sometimes there is controversy in them, fanboys get angry and
whatnot. I have never gotten a "continuous stream of abuse".

Of course, there is plenty of such online abuse. I agree it's terrible
and must stop, but please, don't assume (1) straight white people are
immune to it, and (2) it happens to all non-straight white people.

Also, regarding Adria not being white: What makes you (1) notice that,
and (2) assume it is relevant to the story? That she is a women is
relevant since she brings it up, but I didn't even think about her
ethnicity (why would I care?) until you mentioned it here. In fact I
still don't know (or care) what her ethnicity is.
