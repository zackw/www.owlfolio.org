@Matti, no offense but... you seem to be just regurgitating talking
points you've seen elsewhere on the net.  They're not really relevant
here, because most of the internet's response to the situation isn't
justified *even if* she were some sort of terrible, terrible person.

The blog post by Amanda Blum (linked above) is a much more interesting
and nuanced take on the "anti-Adria" side of things.  It's proof that
there can be debate on the issue without slipping into monkey-land.
