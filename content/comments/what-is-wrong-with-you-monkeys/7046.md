Martijn: It may help to know that a "<a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle" rel="nofollow">dongle</a>"
is a small piece of hardware that plugs into a computer, like a USB
stick; originally it referred to the copy protection devices that came
with expensive CAD software and the like.  The word is similar to one
of the many English slang terms that means "penis" (namely "dong"),
and of course their entire function is to be plugged into another
device, so it's perfect material for the sort of sex joke that is
hilarious if you're twelve, but not if you're older.

I regret to say I have to close comments at this point.  The monkeys
have showed up, and I don't have time to play whack-a-mole.  My email
address is on the contact page if anyone has anything more to say;
thanks to everyone who made this a mostly-constructive discussion to
this point.
