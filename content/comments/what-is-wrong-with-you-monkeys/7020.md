I have very little sympathy for the "she should have handled this
differently" class of arguments, for three reasons.  First, it's
Monday morning quarterbacking.  I wasn't there, you probably weren't
there either, and <a
href="http://subfictional.com/2013/03/22/bold-ideas-uttered-publicly/">there
are all kinds of reasons why what she did may have seemed to be her
best available option at the time</a>.  Second, it has all of the
problems of the <a
href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Tone_argument">tone
argument</a> even if technically it isn't quite the same thing.
Relatedly, who <i>hasn't</i> gotten a little self-righteous and
self-congratulatory on their own blog?  Another thing that there's a
fucking track record of, is <a
href="http://www.npr.org/2011/02/14/133599768/ask-for-a-raise-most-women-hesitate">women,
in particular, not getting cut nearly as much slack as men when they
talk themselves up</a> (buried lede: look for "this hesitation might
be for good reason" about halfway down) and this smells like another
instance of that to me.

But most important of all: you can't have a constructive conversation
about how an incident might have been handled better (by all
concerned) in the middle of an Internet shitstorm.  The moment the
gibbering follow monkeys start throwing feces around, the conversation
is over, and all you can do is raise shields and play whack-a-mole
until they stop.  And I think it's not too much to ask that we all
express some solidarity with the person at the center of the
shitstorm, either&mdash;<i>regardless of what we think of them or
their actions</i>.  We do this for weev, who glories in the title of
"Internet asshole," because nobody should have to go to jail for
issuing a bunch of programmatic GET requests, no matter how much of an
asshole they are; we damn well can do this for Richards, because
nobody should get fired for what she did, and nobody should get
threatened with death, full stop.  That's the really important thing
here.
