HTTPS is an utter pain in the arse. How many one-line HTTPS servers
are you aware of? If you want to put a massive and debilitating
innovation tax on the web, then by all means make HTTPS a requirement
for everyone. For far too long, the web has been just too darn
small-creator-friendly.

The focus for security experts shouldn't be to yoke the web's
developers because of ideology about the how the world should be. It
should be to make good security so simple that it costs next to
nothing (and that includes avoiding the hyper-centralised CA
system). And if you can't achieve that, let us continue the way we
have been for the past 20-ish years.
