Of course everybody would like secrecy, integrity and
authenticity. But nobody wants to be any more beholden to Certificate
Authorities than they already are (since the CA system is basically a
monopolistic protection racket that does not protect you and have no
incentive to). Since authenticity normally are equated with CAs, I can
understand why some might ask the question if there isn't some way
around it. But it isn't authenticity we should try to get around, it
is the CA system. I would hate if Mozilla would force us into the arms
of the CAs.

Maybe something like http://convergence.io/ (presentation:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7Wl2FW2TcA ) could start us down the
road of making CAs "optional". Mozilla is in the position of being
able to do it since it would only require a change to the browser and
a web service (no changes to the sites). And of course some lobbying
to get other browser vendors and notaries on board.

Then you can start requiring certs for all communication.
