I can see where you're coming from, but I think that limiting the
restriction to "features with a clear connection to security and
privacy" does not provide enough encouragement.  The idea is to couple
adoption of HTTPS to adoption of the new shiny things that designers
actively want, whatever those happen to be in release cycle N.

Re mixed content, I suppose I might back down to "the HTML document
and the specific JS or CSS file that requested the new feature, if
any" and leave discouragement of mixed content in general as a
separate ratchet.
