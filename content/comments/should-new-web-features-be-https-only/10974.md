This seems like a backwards way to go about things, and in many cases,
would just make life harder for developers (I'd need to set up
localhost to use HTTPS if I wanted new content features for my test
environment).

If the goal is to force websites to switch to HTTPS, I think it would
make more sense to craft actual, legal regulations requiring it where
it makes sense (which is most places).
