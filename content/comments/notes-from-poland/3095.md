Interesting... I'm planning a trip to Poland (among others) later this
year, so it's good to read your report opinion, and look over the
photos.

I'm curious - was lack of Polish language a much of a problem? While I
want to learn the basics before I go (it's polite, if nothing else),
it would be one of at least five languages I'd need on the trip, so I
can't put really devote as much effort to it as I'd like...
