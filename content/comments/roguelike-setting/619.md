> Avatar death means you-the-player get to pick up another n00b back in town.

You know, in keeping with Mirrlees's themes, you could switch that
around and have the avatar become one of the dead, one of the people
of faerie who're crossing over to "our" world and going on a wholly
different sort of quest.

ETA: and, if one is intent on causing trouble as such an avatar,
perhaps becoming one of those pesky troublemaking creatures who're
attracting the adventurers intent on killing them, or something.
