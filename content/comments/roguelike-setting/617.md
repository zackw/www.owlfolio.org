Well, I'm thinking not <i>exclusively</i> European, but I'm more
concerned with the content of Faerie, on that score, than the border
country.  I have nice reference books on world mythology to mine for
Faerie, but I wouldn't know where to start if I wanted to set the rest
of it in anywhere but 17th-19th century generic Europe.  I suppose I
could do the American Old West, but that has the wrong tone.

Also I am not sure whether Lud-in-the-Mist names would work because,
um, I haven't finished reading the book.  I'd like a Dunsany feel to
the beginning, I think.
