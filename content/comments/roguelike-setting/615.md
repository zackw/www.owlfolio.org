What sort of cultural flavour name? I can do Lud-in-the-Mist style
names easily enough, but that might not be the kind of thing you're
thinking.

My first thought is The Marches of /foo/, because marches are borders
and in that sort of style. My next thought it you could do a lot worse
than just look at lesser known Scottish placenames like Appledore,
Kelsie, Morangie, Gairloch, Ullapool. But if you're thinking
non-European, you probably don't want that sort of line at all.
