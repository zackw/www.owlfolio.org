Btw, with your current script

    â†’ python canonurls.py -q top-1million-urls.txt > results.txt

It seems that the results are stored in memory. I know it just text,
but would not it be better to manage the queue for also writing the
results by batch. It could be every 100 URIs. So you would flush what
is in the memory and if you put a tail on the file results.txt you
could see what's coming in.
