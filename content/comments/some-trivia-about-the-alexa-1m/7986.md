Gorgeous set and analysis. Another interesting facts about Alexa data,
the list by countries are different with different results.

I have seen in your script that you chose `"Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0"`

Note that the results will/might be different depending on your UA
string. Such as for example Opera Presto Desktop.

And even more fun withâ€¦ ;) Firefox OS vs WebKit IOS vs Opera Mobile
for example. It will introduce variability in your results.
