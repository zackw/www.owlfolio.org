In most games, level depends on combat experience.  If someone is more
interested in the non-combat skills (e.g. mining and smithing), having
to go out and kill a bunch of monsters to level up so you can get
better at the parts of the game that you actually find interesting
seems a little strange.  Of course, I'm talking in a more general game
sense, in a classic roguelike I guess the going out and killing
everything you see part is rather important....  But I think I still
wouldn't tie all skills to combat level.
