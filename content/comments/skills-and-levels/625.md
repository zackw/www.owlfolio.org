I envisioned the practice system as working like the skill-points
system you see in a lot of Roguelikes, except that you'd only be able
to allocate points to activities you'd done over the course of gaining
that level.

Another way of doing it is to have a typical skill-point system where
practice improve your _maximum_ skill. Real improvements in the
numbers only come from level-ups or doing something to earn skill
points. That should defuse the part of the powergamer's mind that
wants to see numbers increase.
