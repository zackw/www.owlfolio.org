My grandfather David and his brothers grew up in the small city of
[Ostrowiec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrowiec_%C5%9Awi%C4%99tokrzyski).
They emigrated to the USA in 1938, and as far as I know, none of the
family have set foot in Poland since. Until now; this academic year,
[my sister Dara](http://darastrata.com/) is living in Warsaw on a
[Fulbright scholarship](http://us.fulbrightonline.org/) to study Polish
theater and its relationship to the
[Greek chorus](http://darastrata.com/category/the-chorus/).
[Pam](http://www.pamgriffith.net/) and I went to visit her over the
winter holidays, continuing a
[family tradition of her studying abroad and me visiting](http://www.panix.com/~zackw/exbib/2003/November/).
Here are highlights and selected
photos. [Full photo album, as usual, on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zackw/sets/72157628872510443/).

Dara found us a hotel with all the modern conveniences and
English-speaking staff in downtown Warsaw. This was nice, because it's
the first time (as an adult) I've been to a country where I understood
not one word of the local language upon arrival, and we lost most of
the first few days in-country recovering from Airplane Crud (a
phenomenon not entirely unlike
[Con Crud](http://www.contrapositivediary.com/?p=2125)); I'm glad I
didn't have to negotiate room service in Polish with my brain
operating at less than 50%. We did manage to get out to the
[Palace of Culture and Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Culture_and_Science,_Warsaw)
which was only a few blocks away, and to a luncheon party with some of
Dara's friends from the Fulbright program. When we were feeling a
little better, we walked through the reconstructed Old Town (Warsaw
was quite literally razed to the ground by the Germans during WWII,
but the Poles rebuilt as much as they could manage after the war,
working from photo and art references) and visited the castle of
[Stanisław II August Poniatowski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_August_Poniatowski),
the last king of Poland (1764--1795), which is right in the middle of
the old town. It currently houses two of the three Rembrandt paintings
in Poland, and an exhibition on Stanisław August's life.

[![Me and Pam in front of the Church of the Holiest Saviour, after which

reconstruction of Warsaw, the Communists deliberately arranged for new
buildings further north on the Marszałkowska to block the view of this
church.](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7169/6696389249_eff2f791eb_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zackw/6696389249/ "Me and Pam in front of the Church of the Holiest Saviour, after which Plac Zbawiciela (Saviour Square) is named.

We got better just in time to go to Michałowice, where other friends
of Dara's---specifically, the Szumski family, the principals of
[Teatr Cinema](http://www.teatrcinema.pl/englishcinema.html)---invited
us to their house party for New Year's Eve. This was quite a journey
from Warsaw, beginning with five hours on the train to
[Wrocław](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw). Wrocław survived
the Nazis' hatred of all things Polish almost unscathed, because it
was part of Germany during the war (they called it Breslau). It has
sprawled a bit since then, and I saw some of the Soviet-era slab
apartment blocks on the way out, but its old downtown is still full of
gingerbread townhouses and elaborate civic architecture. We were
trying to conserve our energy for the house party, so we crashed in a
hostel and didn't do very much *in* Wrocław the following day, just
walked around a bit and took photos.

[![Rathaus in Wrocław central
square](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7167/6696403099_1fed5632c2_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zackw/6696403099/ "Rathaus in Wrocław central square")
[![Ever wonder why gingerbread houses look like that? This is
why.](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7148/6696432281_c2e319a908_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/zackw/6696432281/ "Ever wonder why gingerbread houses look like that? This is why.")

The next hop on the journey was a two-hour bus ride to
[Jelenia Góra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jelenia_G%C3%B3ra), which
is in the mountains west of Wrocław, almost to the border with the
Czech Republic.  The son of our host, and five of his buddies, picked
us up from the bus stop in their van, and drove us even farther into
the mountains, to the Szumski house in the small town of
Michałowice. It was what you might call a country mansion, with
several floors and lots of space for guest rooms on the third floor;
they were putting at least ten other people up, besides us. It's full
of art, made by them or their friends.

The house party itself was fairly low-key. Dara and Pam and I had a
game of pool (it is a family tradition that whenever Dara and I are in
the same city, we must play a game of pool somewhere, even though both
of us are terrible at it). There was a jam circle for awhile. There
was lots and lots of food. We had an interesting conversation with a
fellow who's been a doctor in Poland for many years and is now moving
his practice to Denmark. We went to bed pretty much immediately after
midnight, being still tired and not quite well yet. Pam suggested
getting up at nine to celebrate midnight-in-the-USA, but we didn't
actually manage it. I did get some nice pictures of the countryside
the following day, before being driven back down the hill to Jelenia
Góra to catch the bus back to Wrocław.

In Wrocław the following day, we did more walking, out to
"[Cathedral Island](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostr%C3%B3w_Tumski,_Wroc%C5%82aw)."
This was once in fact an island but has since been thoroughly merged
with the north bank of the Oder. It used to be under the Catholic
Church's exclusive jurisdiction, and still houses the official Wrocław
cathedral and the archbishop's residence, plus at least two more large
basilicas. Then we got the train back to Warsaw, which was mildly
entertaining because---quite by accident---we were sitting in the
carriage reserved for families with small children.

Still feeling a little under the weather, we scrubbed prior plans to
visit Krakow and/or Gdansk, and just did a bunch of sight-seeing in
Warsaw. We visited the Old Town again, and the _other_ palace of
Stanisław II August, which is on an artificial lake in Łazienki
Park. As palaces go, this is more of a large house, except that it's
crammed full of art and classically inspired statuary. The park itself
is huge and has lots of other stuff in it, but it was raining, so we
stuck to the palace.

[![Warsaw has lots of these black-and-gray birds; I believe they are

We also got to see the new staging of the great Polish national opera,
[_Halka_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halka), written in 1848 by
librettist Wlodzimierz Wolski and composer
[Stanisław Moniuszko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Moniuszko),
using traditional Polish musical styles (mazurkas, for instance). The
music is inspired; the plot, unfortunately, was pretty threadbare in
1848 and is downright embarrassing today. It's not good when you spend
much of the second half thinking "now would be a great time for Granny
Weatherwax to turn up and scold some sense into everyone." The new
staging was very modern, with minimal set design (except, bizarrely,
at the very end), mostly modern costuming, and an initial filmed
sequence.  As Dara's mentor in Warsaw (a longtime theater critic)
said, this might have worked if they hadn't then gone on to play the
piece 100% straight.  But they did, and it all fell rather
flat. Curiously, one of the characters was acted by one person and
sung by another. I'm not much of an opera buff, so I don't know if
this is common.

Warsaw has several interesting historical museums. We visited the
[biographical museum](http://chopin.museum/en) of
[Fryderyk Chopin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric_Chopin)
and the
[Museum of the Warsaw Uprising](http://www.1944.pl/en/). Chopin spent
most of his adult life in France, but he grew up in Warsaw, and is
still very fondly remembered here; they named the airport after him,
even.  Unfortunately, it's not nearly as much a museum of his _music_
as I would have liked, and the presentation of his _life_ was
interesting but felt a little bereft of historical context. Probably I
would have appreciated it better if I'd grown up in Poland and gotten
their take on history in high school.

Speaking of historical context skimped on in a USAnian education, the
Museum of the Warsaw Uprising is packed full of it. Summarizing
extremely: in the summer of 1944, the Red Army was advancing toward
Warsaw, and the Polish resistance decided it would be a good time to
rise up against the occupying German forces. They did this partly
because they figured the Red Army would back them up, but also because
they were afraid Stalin wanted to conquer Poland or at least set up a
puppet government; this would have been harder if it was the Polish
native resistance that liberated the capital. The resistance was
initially quite successful, but the Red Army only made one half-assed
attempt to cross the Vistula, which was repulsed. After that, they sat
on the east bank and waited while the Germans first put down the
resistance, then burned the city to the ground by way of vengeance.
*Then* they moved in and pushed the Germans out. And Stalin got his
vassal state, just like the Poles had feared.

I'll close with this image, a neon sign in
[Plac Konstytucji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_Square_%28Warsaw%29),
photographed out the window of the taxi taking us back to the airport
to return to the USA. There are lots of these neon signs in Warsaw;
they were erected in the 1960s, and are now considered part of the
city's cultural heritage. Quoting
[this article by David Crowley](https://web.archive.org/web/20110920012007/http://www.polishneon.com/pages/history.html) for the [Neon Muzeum](http://neonmuzeum.org/):

> When the Eastern Bloc tried to cast off the dark shadow of Stalin,
> much attention was given to the appearance of Warsaw. How could it
> be brought back to life? For some, the answer lay in neon. Stolica,
> a popular magazine, led the ‘campaign’ to neonise Warsaw:
> Marszalkowska Residential District – with its monumental sculptural
> ornaments and classical colonnades – would shake off its dreary
> atmosphere with ‘advertising, lighting and neon’. These are ‘the
> elements which in the evening hours lend great liveliness and
> diversity to a city.’
