Title: Postcard from L.A.

I've never liked Los Angeles. It's too hot, to begin with, and it's
the Platonic ideal of everything that's been wrong with American urban
planning since Eisenhower (if not longer): strangling on its own
traffic yet still car-mad, built where the water isn't, and smeared
over a ludicrous expanse of landscape. In the nearly twenty years
since I moved away, all these things have only gotten worse. I only
come back out of family obligation (my parents still live here), which
doesn't help.

This time, though, I find that I am enjoying myself regardless. I'm
here with [my sister](http://darastrata.com/), who *does* like it
here, knows fun things to do and people to hang out with. We're *not*
clear out at the west end of the San Fernando Valley near our parents'
house; we're in North Hollywood, a surprisingly short subway ride from
downtown. (There is a subway now. A heavily used, grungy, practical
subway. I can hardly believe it.) People even seem to be building
somewhat denser. I was able to *walk* to the nearest dry cleaners',
which is also hardly believable.

We went to a show at [Theatre of NOTE](http://www.theatreofnote.com/)
last night, called "Eat the Runt:" billed as black comedy, but really
more of a farce, packed full of in-jokes about museums, grantwriting,
and the entertainment biz, and with the cast randomly assigned to
roles by pulling names out of a hat before each show. It was
hilarious, although I wonder how much it depends on those in-jokes.

At the corner of Hollywood and Vine, the
[Walk of Fame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame)
has a special plaque for the
[Apollo 11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11) astronauts, shaped
like the moon instead of a star, but still with the little brass
old-timey TV. (I suppose it *was* a television broadcast of great
significance, although memorializing it as such seems to miss the
point.) I am not sure how I have managed never to notice this before.

Tonight, there will be more theater. Tomorrow, there will be the
[Huntington Library](http://www.huntington.org/). Monday, back on an
airplane.
