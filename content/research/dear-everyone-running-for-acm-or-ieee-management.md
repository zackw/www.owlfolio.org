It's professional-organization management election time again. This is
my response to everyone who's about to send me an invitation to vote
for them:

When it comes to ACM and IEEE elections, I am a single-issue voter,
and the issue is
[open access to research](http://www.righttoresearch.org/learn/whyOA/index.shtml).
I will vote for you if and only if you make a public statement
committing to aggressive pursuit of the following goals within your
organization, in decreasing order of priority:

1. As immediately as practical, begin providing to the general public
   zero-cost, no-registration, no-strings-attached online access to new
   publications in your organization's venues.

2. Commit to a timetable (which should also be as quickly as practical,
   but could be somewhat slower than for the above) for opening up your
   organization's older publications to zero-cost, no-registration,
   no-strings-attached online access.

3. Abandon the practice of requiring authors to assign copyright to your
   organization; instead, require only a license substantively similar to
   [that requested by USENIX](https://www.usenix.org/node/73711) (exclusive
   publication rights for no longer than 12 months with exception for
   posting an electronic copy on your own website, nonexclusive right to
   continue disseminating afterward).

4. On a definite timetable, revert copyright to all authors who
   published under the old copyright policy, retaining only the rights
   requested under the new policy.

Thank you for your consideration.
