For the past few months I've been working on a research study of "active
geolocation" algorithms.  These attempt to determine where in the world
a computer is, by measuring how long it takes network messages from that
computer to reach other computers in known locations.

In order to test some of these algorithms thoroughly, I need volunteers
who are willing to run my measurement software on their computers, and
tell me where they are. Iâ€™m especially interested in data reported
from computers that are not in Europe nor North America, but data from
anywhere is useful.  Currently, running the software takes a fair bit of
technical skill---if you're not comfortable with the Unix command line,
please wait for the friendlier web-based version which is in development.

If you're interested, please go to

for further instructions.

(For legal reasons, you must be at least 18 years old to volunteer.)

(Reproduction and dissemination of this call for volunteers is encouraged.)
