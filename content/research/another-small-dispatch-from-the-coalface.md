For all countries for which [Herdict](https://www.herdict.org/)
contains enough reports to be credible (concretely, such that the
error bars below cover less than 10% of the range), the estimated
probability that a webpage will be inaccessible. Vertically sorted by
the left edge of the error bar. Further right is worse. I suspect
*major* systemic errors in this data set, but it's the only data set
in town.
