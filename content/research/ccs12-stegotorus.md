Title: CCS'12: StegoTorus
Date: 2012-10-16 19:12
Slug: ccs12-stegotorus

I just presented the major focus of my time and effort for the past
year-and-a-bit, [StegoTorus](/media/2010/05/stegotorus.pdf), at this
year's ACM [Conference on Computer and Communications
Security](http://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2012/). You can see [my
slides](/media/2010/05/stegotorus-talk/) and [the
code](https://gitweb.torproject.org/stegotorus.git) ([also at
Github](https://github.com/zackw/stegotorus)). I was going to explain in
more detail but all of the brain went into actually giving the talk. My
apologies.

This is an ongoing project and we are looking for help; please do get in
touch if you're interested.
