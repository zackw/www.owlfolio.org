I just presented the major focus of my time and effort for the past
year-and-a-bit, [StegoTorus](https://research.owlfolio.org/pubs/2012-stegotorus.pdf), at this
year's ACM
[Conference on Computer and Communications Security](http://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2012/).
You can see [my slides](https://research.owlfolio.org/pubs/2012-stegotorus-talk/) and
[the code](https://gitweb.torproject.org/stegotorus.git)
([also at Github](https://github.com/TheTorProject/stegotorus)). I was
going to explain in more detail but all of the brain went into
actually giving the talk. My apologies.

This is an ongoing project and we are looking for help; please do get in
touch if you're interested.
