I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A JOB. DO NOT CONTACT ME WITH ANY SORT OF JOB OFFER.

I prefer, by orders of magnitude, email to any other communication
medium.  My address is [zackw@panix.com](mailto:zackw@panix.com).

I may also be found on various community-type websites, in decreasing
order of frequency of use:

* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elwoz): elwoz
* [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@zwol): zwol
* [Newsblur](https://zwol.newsblur.com/): zwol
* [Github](https://github.com/zackw): zackw
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/388520) and relatives: zwol
* [Keybase](https://keybase.io/zackw): zackw
* [Dreamwidth](http://zwol.dreamwidth.org/): zwol
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zackweinberg): Zack Weinberg
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/elwoz): Zack Weinberg
* [Google+](https://plus.google.com/108735008363901796353/about): Zack Weinberg

Of the above, only Twitter, Mastodon, Newsblur, and Github are
any real use if you want to _communicate_ with me; I rarely look at
the others.  I won't respond to invitations to new social networking
websites; it's not you, it's the medium.

I am also "zwol" on IRC; I frequent
[darkmyst.org](http://www.darkmyst.org/) and
[oftc.net](http://www.oftc.net/).

The handle "zwol" is my first initial plus "wol," as in the owl from
the [Pooh stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh).
It has nothing to do with the moribund webcomic at
[zwol.org](http://www.zwol.org/), although I did read that when it was
still updating.  Someone else is "zwol" on Twitter so I have to settle
for a mangled version.

I have a
[PGP key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x91FCC32B6769AA64)
should you wish to send me something s3kr1t.  The fingerprint is

    4096R/6769AA64  82F8 54F3 CE73 174B 8B63  1740 91FC C32B 6769 AA64

I used to use another key, but it is quite old and has now been revoked:

    1024D/797DC75F  A29C E8FD 999C 5BB4 C446  978F 51C6 3320 797D C75F

### Answers to Frequent Rhetorical Questions {#afrq}

Every time I go through my spam queue I find questions or comments
that *could be* real, if not for the fact that I've seen them dozens
of times before, and/or the site they're obviously shilling for.
Still, I feel like they deserve some sort of response, so here are
mine, in no particular order.

* Thank you for your kind words.
* My contact information is at the top of the page you are reading right now.
* I am not interested in carrying advertising on this site.
* If you want to know how this site is constructed, please see the
  [colophon](/about/#colophon).
* Why yes, I *do* get a lot of spam.  [Akismet](http://akismet.com/)
  helps, but is less effective than I'd like.  Suggestions welcome.
* I don't worry about people "ripping off" my "content;" I
  [encourage the reproduction and dissemination](http://www.popmartian.com/mcelwaine/)
  of my writing.  That's why it's
  [CC licensed](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).  If
  you do something interesting with my writing, like the old post on
  [boxes with rounded corners](/htmletc/border-radius/) that someone
  translated into Russian (or a close relative), and you tell me about
  it, I may well link to it.
* If anything, I think I should be striving to make my posts shorter,
  not longer.
* No, I don't think my usual topics could be improved by the addition
  of photos, stock or otherwise.
* I am quite happy with my SEO the way it is, thanks.
* I'm sorry, I don't know anything about wireless repeaters.
* What video? There has never been any video here.  Move along.
