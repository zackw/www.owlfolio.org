<p>Hello, my name is Zachary Weinberg.  I go by “Zack,” except on
paper. Pleased to meet you.</p>

<p>I’m about thirty-five years old, and I grew up in the suburbs of
Los Angeles, California.  I’m presently a <a
href="http://websec.sv.cmu.edu/">researcher of Internet security</a>
at <a href="http://www.sv.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University,
Silicon Valley</a>.  Before that I worked for the <a
href="http://www.mozilla.com/">Mozilla Corporation</a>, and before
<i>that</i> I studied how people understand language at <a
href="http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/">UC San Diego</a>.</p><p>My
interests range all over the sciences and a little way into
philosophy, plus some of the arts (notably, candle-making, pottery,
and game design).  This website is intended to capture all of the
ideas that to date haven’t made it out of the back of my mind, so will
be wide-ranging as well.</p><p>Everything dated prior to August 2009
on this site was originally posted on my <a
href="http://zwol.livejournal.com/">LiveJournal</a>.  I don’t plan to
continue doing this—new stuff will appear either here or there, not
both.</p>

<h3 id="glossary">Glossary</h3>

If you meet me in person, you may hear me say some of these things:

<dl>
<dt>Have fun!</dt>
<dd><p>I often say this when people are departing to do something not
normally considered fun, like grocery shopping.  Probably picked up
from Pam and her mother, who also do this.</p></dd>

<dt>I’m turning into a pumpkin</dt>
<dd><p>“I’m exhausted,” or “I need to leave soon.”  I also say “I will
turn into a pumpkin at (time)” to warn people that I will be leaving
at a particular time.</p><p>A Cinderella reference, naturally.  I used
to think I was the only person who said this, but it turns out that my
mother and grandmother say it too.</p></dd>

<dt>I think we all know what consciousness is</dt>
<dd><p>Pam and I say this when someone has just skimmed blithely past
a major unresolved scientific or philosophical question.  We’re
quoting someone who said it without a trace of irony, during a
discussion on a cognitive science mailing list.</p></dd>

<dt>Say again?</dt>
<dd><p>I have trouble hearing people over background noise.  I use
this bit of military/aviator jargon instead of “Huh?” or “What?”
because it unambiguously expresses “I didn’t <i>hear</i> what you
said” rather than “I didn’t <i>understand</i> what you said.”</p></dd>

<dt>The thing my aunt gave me that I don’t know what it is
<dd><p>I never say this verbatim, but I use this construction (“that”
or “which” followed by a complete sentence) all the time, contra
typical English usage.  I think I got it from the object with a very
similar name in the <i>Hitchhiker’s Guide</i> text adventure.</p></dd>

<dt>Who shuffled this mess?</dt>
<dd><p>When playing cards, means “This hand is so terrible that I
don’t believe the deck was shuffled properly.”  By extension, can be
used to complain about any sort of bad luck.</p><p>From my
grandmother, who would often say it and then go on to win the round
anyway.  For maximum humor, say it when <i>you</i> shuffled the mess
in question.</p></dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="colophon">Colophon</h3>

<p>Site design was done by me, with a great deal of help from <a
href="http://www.pamgriffith.net/">Pam Griffith</a>, whose design-fu
is far superior.</p>

<p>Body text is set in <a
href="http://impallari.com/quattrocentosans">Quattrocento Sans</a>,
headings in <a href="http://scholarsfonts.net/cardofnt.html">Cardo</a>
(subset), and monospace (e.g. code samples) in <a
href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata</a>.
The face in the top banner was constructed by me using <a
href="http://www.picassohead.com/">Mr. Picassohead</a>. The owl which
may or may not be visible at the very bottom of each page, depending
on your browser and screen size, was originally a pen-and-ink drawing
of <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/angrypirate/490251884/in/photostream/"><i>two</i>
owls on a branch</a> by <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/people/angrypirate/">Alanna Risse</a>.
The background textures are based on the <a
href="http://subtlepatterns.com/handmade-paper/">handmade paper</a>
texture from <a href="http://subtlepatterns.com/">Subtle
Patterns</a>.</p>

<p>The CMS is <a href="http://getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, with a
theme customized from the ground up for this site.  If it doesn’t look
terrible in old versions of Internet Explorer, that is thanks
to <a href="https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv">the HTML5 Shiv</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond">Respond.js</a>.</p></p>

<p>Hosting is
at <a href="https://www.nearlyfreespeech.net/">NearlyFreeSpeech.NET</a>,
which I do recommend, but if this site appears to load faster than
others, it’s probably more because
of <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/hpws/">Steve Souders’
advice</a>.

<p>I write all my posts
in <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/README.html">Pandoc-flavor
Markdown</a>, because HTML is far too verbose to put up with while
composing, but WYSIWYG ceased to be my friend in the days of Microsoft
Word 4.0.</p>
