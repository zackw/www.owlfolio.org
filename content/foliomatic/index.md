title: Foliomatic
...

Foliomatic is a hypothetical program for generating web sites like
this one. Iâ€™m currently using [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/),
which is a vast improvement over [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/),
which was in turn a vast improvement over [Ikiwiki](https://ikiwiki.info/),
but it still gets in my way enough to irritate me.

Unlike the game designs I have devoted many words to, I do intend to
write Foliomatic someday, but it might be a good long time. Meanwhile,
here are notes.
