![Semi-anthropomorphic sketches of six owls, each with a different
facial expression and labeled with the name of a different
coffee-related beverage: decaf (asleep), half-caf (awake, but not happy
about it), regular (a little more awake and still not happy about it),
Irish coffee (cheerfully buzzed), espresso (unable to blink), double
espresso (oh dear, it's gone all the way to
knurd).](/media/2013/04/owly-morning.jpg)
