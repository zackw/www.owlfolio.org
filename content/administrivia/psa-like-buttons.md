Because I hit "empty spam" just a little too fast, erasing the question
about this: There are no Facebook "like" buttons on this site because I
myself barely ever use Facebook and don't really see the point; same
same digg, reddit, etc. If you like something you read here enough to
want to promote it, please consider mentioning it somewhere you can put
in a few words to explain why people should click through (twitter,
Facebook wall, sort of thing). Or write a full-sized response article
and link back.
