I currently syndicate everything on this blog to Planet Mozilla. Given
the ongoing discussion of what does and does not belong there, I would
like to poll the audience: How do you feel about any of the following
topics appearing on Planet?

* Details of my recent trip to $COUNTRY
* Offers to give away unwanted items prior to moving
* Musings about pottery
* Musings about video game design
* Small programs that were a pain to write and might be useful to
  someone else maybe someday
* Various Internet-security-related topics which may or may not have
  anything to do with The Web
* incredibly hypothetical ideas, zany schemes, and related
  philosophizing
* detailed reports on my academic research
* explanations for a lay audience of how to use the Internet safely
* summaries of the research presented at $CONFERENCE

This is a sincere question, which I am asking in order to decide
whether I, personally, should start filtering what gets syndicated to
Planet from here.
