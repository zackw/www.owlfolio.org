supposing  
for the sake of argument  
that you had a giant list  
of partial URLs  
(you know, like "www.example.com/blurf")  
and you needed to canonicalize them  
and chase redirects  
and remove duplicates  
and dead sites  
and further you were aware  
that this is much harder than it might sound  
not to mention  
that many websites do not like
[urllib](http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html)  
well then  
[you might be looking for this program](/scratchpad/canonurls)  
which was written by me  
with a little help from [serge
broslavsky](http://stackoverflow.com/users/129815/serge-broslavsky).
