Title: Do not do business with Northwest Talent Search

A depressing number of computer industry recruiters cannot be bothered
to read the very first paragraph of my LinkedIn profile (which is now
also the first paragraph of the "[contact information](/contact/)"
page of this very website---probably should have done that years ago),
or else they think they are ~special snowflakes~ and it does not apply
to them.  For reference, this paragraph reads

> I AM NOT LOOKING FOR A JOB. DO NOT CONTACT ME WITH ANY SORT OF JOB OFFER.

I get unwanted solicitations about once a month, and I reply with a
polite but acerbic note about how they should've noticed the paragraph
in ALL CAPS that says don't contact me, and _usually_ that's the end
of it.

Last week I got one from an outfit calling itself "Northwest Talent
Search, Inc."  (They don't have a website.)  It does just about
everything wrong:

> Hello Zack
>
> I am working with one of the fastest growing startups in
> the world on a Aspiring Software Engineering Manager search. They
> just landed a major partnership with a fortune 500 company. If you
> have an interest in joining a world class team and an incredible
> opportunity what would be a good time for a phone call and a good
> number to reach you at?
>
> Thanks<br>
> [REDACTED]<br>
> [REDACTED]@northwesttalentsearch.com

Besides ignoring the request not to contact me: Why would anyone not
want to know _which_ startup, _which_ megacorp, and at least the
executive summary of the concrete job description?  If you're going to
cold-contact people with job offers, these things should _always_
appear in the initial message.  And anyone who has done their due
diligence on _me_ should know that I'm not the right candidate for any
sort of engineering management position and I'm allergic to startups.
So I was less polite than I usually am, when replying:

> Thank you for your interest, however:
>
> 1) I have made it abundantly clear, both on my personal website, and
> everywhere recruiters typically trawl for interesting people, that I
> am not looking for a job and do not want to be cold-contacted with
> job offers.
>
> 2) I have neither any interest nor any qualifications for an
> engineering management position, and I do not understand how you
> could possibly have gotten the impression that I might be an
> appropriate candidate for such.
>
> 3) As a matter of basic courtesy, *in your initial message* you
> should have stated the name of the company you are recruiting for
> and given a couple sentences' description of what business they are
> in and what the job responsibilities are.
>
> Never contact me again. Do not even reply to this message.

Now, if that had been the end of it, you wouldn't be reading this post.
_Today_ I received _this:_

> Hello Zack
>
> I am working with one of the fastest growing startups in the world on
> a Backend Engineer search. They just landed a major partnership with a
> fortune 500 company. If you have an interest in joining a world class

> [SAME PERSON]<br>
> [SAME EMAIL]@northwesttalentsearch.com

The _only change_ is the job title.  "Backend Engineer" is _less_
wrong than "Aspiring Software Engineering Manager," but it's still
wrong.  And sending another instance of what is evidently a form
letter, after having been told not to contact me again, is both
disrespectful and unprofessional.

Hence what I dearly hope will be my final reply to them, and this post.

If you're a company looking to hire: Don't do business with these
clowns, there are people who will do much better by you.

If you're also getting these: I strongly suspect you don't want any of
the jobs they are soliciting for.
