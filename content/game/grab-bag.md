Basic flavor elements:

-   magic is wild; somewhat unpredictable, from the heart as well as the
    head
-   The High Elves were Not Nice. I'm thinking more like Pratchett's
    depiction than e.g. Michael Moorcock's. Also, they're all dead.
-   from *Earthdawn*: putting back together a very broken world
-   keep the horror subtle, though (rugose, squamous ascii art! ha.)
-   references to high fantasy kept small - mob monsters ok, plot
    monsters not
-   take plot monsters from where? perhaps mythology?
-   references to real world should not be exclusively European
-   e.g. Chinese dragons, not European (also, dragons are much too
    badass to fight)
-   steampunk technology is fun and could add interest
-   high technology doesn't fit, though

Fun stuff:

-   Ursula Vernon wombats and weird fruit
-   *Secrets of the Gnomes* gnomes
-   Nomadic carpet makers? Flying!
-   Non-Euclidean overworld map
-   ...gets more Euclidean as the plot advances?
-   Jelaza Kazone-type sapient trees
-   At least one type of magic done with bells.
