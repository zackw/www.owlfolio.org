Over the past few weeks there has been what I can only describe as an
epic flame war on LJ and elsewhere. I am not going to link to any of
it or try to summarize. Suffice to say that it started out about
racism, cultural appropriation, and privilege, and that buried in the
turd-flinging (which I did not read all of, by any means) there were
some really good points made on those topics.

This has gotten me thinking about cultural appropriation and
privileged narratives in the context of video games, and especially
that roguelike I'm not writing. Video games are not where one
generally goes for great storytelling or cultural sensitivity, but
(assuming I were writing one) why should I make that any worse than it
is? And the major motivation for the hypothetical roguelike is that
the storytelling in roguelikes is threadbare, so if I'm wanting to
make that better, why not be *really* ambitious and try to fix
everything at once? So let's have another look at the plot of that
game with privilege and appropriation in mind.

<!--more-->

I posted a [plot sketch](http://zwol.livejournal.com/57371.html) and
some [flavor notes](http://zwol.livejournal.com/57842.html) the last
time I talked about this. The condensed version is: the player
character lives in a country with a geographic border with
Faerie. Faerie is reportedly all torn up with war and disaster, so the
PC decides to go exploring, because maybe there is treasure to be
looted. Of course there is, but also it turns out that the entire
otherworld is coming apart at the seams, and the PC is in a position
to stop that, encourage it, or take advantage of it. I hadn't decided
why this was happening in the first place. Being a roguelike, the PC
will die a lot, but there are a whole group of people back in the
border country doing this, so the player can just switch to a new one.

The problem I see with this narrative is that it can easily turn into
either straight-up colonialism (if the PCs take advantage of the mess
to take over Faerie or just steal all the gold and nifty magic
doodads) or
“[what these people need is a honky](http://oyceter.livejournal.com/602541.html)”
(if the PCs make everything better for the fair folk). But is this
really the narrative's fault? This is a roguelike we're talking about
here. The core gameplay is, by definition, about killing monsters and
taking their stuff. And any video game with a plot is going to have
some degree of “what these people need is a player character,” or else
the PC has no agency and the player is bored.

Perhaps the problem is with the genre, then? Perhaps the world does
not need another game where what you do is kill the monsters and take
their stuff. The obvious way to fit that into the roguelike milieu is
if it initially appears that you are out to kill the monsters and take
their stuff, but then that turns out to be a really bad
idea. Consider: even in the midst of war and disaster, we humans take
the time to hunt down murderers. Why wouldn't goblins, kappas, nagas
do the same? Kill a “monster” and the police come after you. Put
together a gang of bandits and terrorize a village, and the local
*military* comes after you (like in *The Seven Samurai*). You can keep
fighting but the difficulty curve goes up way faster than you can
level. This can even be extended to non-sentient species; there are
plenty of stories where the local spirits (or the local game wardens)
become homicidally angry when you hunt in the wrong place. Conversely,
help out that lion with a thorn in its paw, and you've got a friend;
be consistently kind to animals and you have a pack.

Okay, so the PC is not killing the monsters and taking their stuff, so
what is he or she doing instead? War implies factions, and disasters
have causes. If there is a long history of wary relations across the
border, one or more of the factions could easily reach out for allies
in a troubled time. I envision this as much more of an exploration
game than a tactics game, so perhaps the war is over, everyone lost,
and the hope is that the mundane PCs are resistant to the magical
fallout that is stopping the fair folk from reclaiming their
cities. Or at least they're more expendable. This puts a lot more load
on the AI for non-combat interactions with NPCs but I don't think it's
intractable; over in console RPG land people have been doing amazing
things with canned dialogue trees for some time.

[elsmi](http://elsmi.livejournal.com/) had
[another idea](http://shweta-narayan.livejournal.com/17220.html?thread=239684#t239684):
perhaps the abandoned castles were built by a previous wave of
colonists, and “there may come a point when [the PCs] gain an urgent
interest in *why* the last guys felt they needed big castles, and why
exactly they aren't there anymore...” I like this notion, but I
hesitate to have the previous wave of colonists come from the same
country as the PCs, because then you'd expect all the locals to hate
the PCs on sight.  It's tempting to borrow a notion from *Doc Sidhe*
and have there have been an indigenous oppressor class, those High
Elves that Pratchett and Moorcock are at pains to remind us were as
cruel as they were beautiful.  [elsmi](http://elsmi.livejournal.com/)
also suggests a vaguely modern setting for the nonmagical land, which
is attractive just because it hasn't been done much.

If you're still reading: Is this still potentially a fun game? What do
you think of the revised setting? What overused and/or privileged
tropes am I still not avoiding/subverting?
