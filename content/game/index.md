Title: Game design

I play lots of games. Board games, video games, “tabletop” roleplaying
games. I occasionally have ideas for designing my own games. It’s
unlikely that I’ll ever sit down and write a complete game, so instead
I write the ideas down and put them here.  Sometimes I also write up
critical thoughts about other people’s games.
