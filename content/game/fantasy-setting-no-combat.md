Whereupon it occurred to me that this is one of the big reasons I
don't play [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)
anymore. The parts of DF that I enjoy are city-building, prospecting
for minerals to make stuff out of, and trade. Manufacturing is too
much of a micromanagey pain in the ass, and everything to do with
building up an army bores me to tears (it doesn't help that that is
*also* far too micromanagey for my taste, and depends on
manufacturing). Further, all the development since the first 3D
version has been focused on precisely the parts I don't like. But it's
a damn shame, because I *really* enjoy the city-building and the
mining.

At about the same time, [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) had just
started making the big news. I tried to get it to run, discovered that
this would require more than zero messing with a Java installation,
and gave up. But I watched a bunch of the
"[X's Adventures in Minecraft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bh4EexJO4I)"
Let's Play videos, enough to get a pretty good idea of what the
gameplay is like.  It seems like I'd have much the same opinion of it
that I do of DF: yay exploring, yay building, boo micromanagement, boo
having to fight monsters.

And this was also about the time I gave up on
[Lord of Ultima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_Ultima), which
was a massively-multiplayer territorial competition game that *billed*
itself as allowing a purely economic strategy---but it turned out that
past a certain point everyone has far more resources than they need,
so the only remaining thing to do is fight; I have absolutely no
interest in PvP army duels, and guess what? Also with the way too much
micromanagement! (You can pay for UX enhancements that mitigate this,
but it didn't appear that they improved it *enough*, and the only way
I'll pay for a premium game is if I'm already having tons of fun with
the free edition.)

Finally, longtime readers will remember that the last thing I said
about [that roguelike I'm not writing](/game/nethack/) was that
[perhaps the world does not need another game where what you do is kill the monsters and take their stuff](/game/appropriation-privilege-and-video-games/).
But I'm still interested in the notion of a game where you're
exploring an otherworld that's coming apart at the seams, and maybe
trying to put it back together again. So here's a set of design
elements, that feel like they add up to a game:

* Gameplay is about exploration, construction, manufacturing, and trade.
* Multiplayer interaction, if any, is all about the trading.
* Micromanagement is to be avoided with extreme prejudice.
* No fighting.
* No crafting of legendary weapons or armor, either.
* "[Like reality unless noted](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LikeRealityUnlessNoted)"
  applies to geology, biology, and technology.
* Magic is not tame.
* Magic is *not* only for *special* people.
* It might be nice to try to subvert
  "[Our Dwarves Are All The Same](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OurDwarvesAreAllTheSame)"
  but then again, there's a reason why that characterization works so well.

The tricky part is finding a source of conflict, since we've taken out
all the fighting. Perhaps the "coming apart at the seams" thing is
enough of an issue to hang a plot on? If not, there is always politics
and diplomacy, particularly if we make it hard for a settlement to be
entirely self-sufficient. Not all minerals are found under the same
mountain; not all biomes are suitable for subsistence farming.

I think this would work well with a zoom level roughly the same as DF
fortress mode: player sets goals, individual simulated characters
carry them out to the best of their ability. Simulated characters push
back on the player to fulfill their desires and carry out their
agendas, but (unlike DF nobility, for instance) there is a way for the
player to say no. Which has consequences, of course, but less-bad
consequences than what happens if you ignore a production order in DF.
