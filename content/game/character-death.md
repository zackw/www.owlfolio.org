We're playing *God of War* again and have gotten Kratos killed, oh, at
least fifty times now, by falling off the rafters that you have to
thread your way through while avoiding the rotating knife arms. In the
Challenge of Hades. If you've played the game I'm sure you know what I
mean.Anyway, every time he dies we just restart from the convenient save
point at the beginning of the room with the rafters. Often we think of
save points are an entirely out-of-game-world mechanism for making death
be a minor frustration (or a major one, as in this case) rather than end
of story. In light of my previous rant about the inappropriateness of
the "send the hero off to the deathtrap of a temple" strategy for saving
Athens, though ... what if we construe them as in-world? Every time
Kratos dies, the gods restore him to life and dump him back at the most
recent save point or checkpoint. (I guess they aren't allowed to put him
ahead of the trap that keeps killing him, for the same reason they can't
just teleport him to the room with the godslayer weapon...) There's
nothing overt in the game to indicate this, unlike some (e.g. Ultima, as
[madmanatw](http://madmanatw.livejournal.com/) pointed out last time)
but the save points do say "Zeus offers you the opportunity to save your
progress".If so, Athena's strategy is less horrible than it seemed -
Kratos will eventually, if only by sheer luck, get through the temple.
Perhaps there won't be any of the city left to save, but at least she
can have her revenge on Ares. On the other hand, it's a good thing
Kratos is completely insane already, because otherwise he would be after
a few dozen cycles of that treatment!

[EDIT: Ok, so now we hit a
completely different headache: the minotaur boss. All the walkthroughs
seem to assume that the O-button minigame is trivial; we are finding it
impossible (well, we got it *once* but only by chance). I don't have any
idea how to integrate that into this theory.]

[SON OF EDIT: Pam, having
gotten sick of it, informs me that she knows how to do the minigame now,
but that you have to do it *just exactly right* or you fail. We do not
approve.]
