My SO and I are moving. We have a whole lot of ceramic objects that we
made. We would like to send them to people rather than find a new home
for a giant stack of pottery in our new apartment. Please let us know
what you want and we'll send it to you!

(Please post requests *on the Flickr pages for the objects you want*, if
at all possible.)

**EDIT 23 Jun 2010: This offer is no longer open. We have donated
what hadn't already been claimed to the San Jose chapter of [Empty
Bowls](http://www.emptybowls.net/).**
