One of the most common ways to start interacting with a free software
*project*, as opposed to just using the *software* produced by that
project, is when you trip over a bug or a missing feature and now you
need to go tell the developers about it. Unfortunately, that process
is often incredibly off-putting. If there's a bug tracking system, it
is probably optimized for people who spend all day every day working
with it, and may appear to demand all kinds of information you have no
idea how to supply. If there isn't, you're probably looking at signing
up for some sort of mailing list (*mailing list!* how retro!) Either
way, it may not be easy to find, and there's a nonzero chance that
some neckbeard with a bad attitude is going to yell at you. It
shouldn't be so, but it is.

So, I make this offer to you, the general public, as I have been doing
for close friends for many years: if you don't want to deal with that
shit, **I will file bugs for you.** I've been on the Internet since
not *quite* the
[elder days](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September), and
I've been hacking free software almost as long; I know how to find
these people and I know how to talk to them. We'll have a conversation
and we'll figure out exactly what's wrong and then I'll take it from
there. I'm best at compilers and Web browsers, but I'll give anything
a shot.

<small>THE FINE PRINT: If you want to take me up on this, please do so
*only* via email; my address is on the [Contact page](/contact/).
Please allow up to one week for an initial response, as this service
is provided in my
[copious free time](https://foldoc.org/copious+free+time).</small>

<small>Offer valid only for free software (also known as "open
source") (as opposed to software that you are not allowed to modify or
redistribute, e.g. Microsoft Word). Offer also only valid for problems
which I can personally reproduce; it's not going to go well for anyone
involved if I have to play telephone with you and the
developers. Offer specifically *not* valid for operating system
kernels or device drivers of any kind, both because those people are
even less pleasant to work with than the usual run of neckbeards, and
because that class of bugs tends to be hardware-dependent and
therefore difficult for me to personally reproduce on account of I
don't have the exact same computer as you.</small>

<small>The management cannot guarantee this service will cause bugs to
actually get *fixed* in any kind of timely fashion, or, in fact,
ever.</small>
