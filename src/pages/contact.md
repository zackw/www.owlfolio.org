DO NOT CONTACT ME WITH ANY SORT OF JOB OFFER,
unless you are responding to an application
that I filed with your organization.

I prefer, by orders of magnitude, email to any other communication medium.
My permanent email address is
[zack@owlfolio.org](mailto:zack@owlfolio.org).
The older address at
[zackw@panix.com](mailto:zackw@panix.com)
still works.

I may also be found on various community-type websites,
in decreasing order of frequency of use:

* Fediverse: [@zwol@hackers.town](https://hackers.town/@zwol)
  (formerly [@zwol@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@zwol))
* [Newsblur](https://zwol.newsblur.com/): zwol
* [Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~zackw): zackw
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/388520) and relatives: zwol
* [Dreamwidth](https://zwol.dreamwidth.org/): zwol (no longer updated)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elwoz): elwoz (no longer updated)

I won’t respond to invitations to new social networking websites;
it’s not you, it’s the medium.

The handle “zwol,” which I use whenever possible,
is my first initial plus “wol,” as in the owl from
the [Pooh stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh).
It has nothing to do with the moribund webcomic
at [zwol.org](https://www.zwol.org/),
although I did read that when it was still updating.

I have a
[PGP key](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/82F854F3CE73174B8B63174091FCC32B6769AA64)
should you wish to send me something s3kr1t.  The fingerprint is

    4096R/6769AA64  82F8 54F3 CE73 174B 8B63  1740 91FC C32B 6769 AA64

I used to use another key, but it is quite old and has now been revoked:

    1024D/797DC75F  A29C E8FD 999C 5BB4 C446  978F 51C6 3320 797D C75F


### Answers to Frequent Rhetorical Questions {#afrq}

Over a decade ago,
this site ran on [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/),
which meant I got a lot of spam comments,
some of which felt like they deserved some sort of response.
In no particular order:

* Thank you for your kind words.
* My contact information is at the top of the page you are reading right now.
* I am not interested in carrying advertising on this site.
* If you want to know how this site is constructed, please see the
  [colophon](/about/#colophon).
* I don’t worry about people “ripping off” my “content;”
  I [encourage the reproduction and dissemination](https://www.popmartian.com/mcelwaine/)
  of my writing.
  That’s why it’s [CC licensed](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).
  If you do something interesting with my writing,
  like the old post on [boxes with rounded corners](/htmletc/border-radius/)
  that someone translated into Russian (or a close relative),
  and you tell me about it,
  I may well link to it.
* If anything,
  I think I should be striving to make my posts shorter,
  not longer.
* No, I don’t think my usual topics could be improved
  by the addition of photos,
  stock or otherwise.
* I am quite happy with my SEO the way it is, thanks.
* I’m sorry, I don’t know anything about wireless repeaters.
* What video? There has never been any video here.
