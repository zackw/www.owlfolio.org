I totally agree that Git's command-line interface is confusing, and
its docs are only useful if you already understand what the command
does.

This is not true at all.

The only command in Git that destroys commit data (as far as I'm
aware, and I'm no expert, so this is probably wrong) is `git gc`.
There are other commands which will wipe out uncommitted changes to
your repository, of course, just like `hg up -C`.

If you mess up a `git rebase` or a `git reset --hard` or anything
else, you have not lost any data!  All you've done is change your
branch from pointing to commit X to pointing to commit Y.  If you want
to change it back to X, you can run `git reflog`, find the hash of X,
and then `git reset --hard X`.  Nothing was lost.

It's not intuitive, but it /is/ easy once you get the hang of it.
