Curious; short of actual bugs, I can only think of <i>one</i> hg
command that has the potential to destroy data, and it's quite clearly
labeled as such (<code>hg strip</code>).  In contrast, every git
command that either brings new changesets into the repository, or
changes the relationship of the working copy to history, seems to have
the potential to destroy data.  In my hands, anyway.  Do you happen to
remember what Audacious devs were doing that was causing so much
trouble?

I find index/working copy entirely unnecessary (and an irritating
speed bump for people used to older VCSes) but I haven't had it blow
up in my face, so that's a point in its favor.  What do you need it
for?
