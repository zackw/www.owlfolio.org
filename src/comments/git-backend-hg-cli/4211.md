It may be true that more skilled hands could have repaired all of my
broken Git repositories without having to re-clone.  I have
occasionally been able to do it myself, even.

But I don't especially <i>care</i>, because, Mercurial <i>never puts
me in this situation in the first place</i>, whereas Git does it to me
at least once a week (of active development time).  I'm really not
kidding about either of those estimates.
