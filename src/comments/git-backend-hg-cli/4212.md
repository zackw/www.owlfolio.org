Regarding the value of Git's staging area, I think this is a matter of
the kind of changes I tend to make and the kind of code I tend to be
working on: When I'm in the situation where several changes have
gotten tangled together, being able to select individual files, or
individual diff hunks, or even individual <i>lines</i> and pull them
out to their own patch wouldn't actually help me any, because the
interdependence is inevitably within code expressions.  My process in
that situation is to dump the entire mess into an MQ patch and then
manually break it up with Emacs' diff-mode, which allows me to make
arbitrary edits to both sides of the split.
