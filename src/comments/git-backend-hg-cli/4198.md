Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's not the data model, which I think is
solid. It has been explained to me (similar to what Justin mentions)
that it's really hard to lose data with git even when using things
that would be equivalent to hg strip; they just disappear from the
UI. There are tools to get them back (unless the gc happens, of
course). In fact, the guy who explained this to me said that he had
had more data loss with Mercurial, in particular by using MQ, which
can indeed be a bit dangerous, because it's far too easy to mess up a
patch file on disk.

Mercurial is actually moving in the direction of being more git-like
in this regard with the recent support for changeset phases and the
near-future support for changeset obsolescence, which in the long run
should replace MQ for most users.
