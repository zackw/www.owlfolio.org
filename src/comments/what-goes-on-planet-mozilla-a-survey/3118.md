First, I don't actually read Planet, and I haven't for a couple years
or so.  I read enough feeds that I needed to start pruning somewhere,
and subscribing to everyone but then removing individual Mozilla feeds
was the way to do it.  (Which ones?  Meeting minutes, most
marketing/PR since I'm developer-oriented, increasingly some webdev
stuff because no matter what I might wish I'm not close enough to
modern webdev to be likely to use it or get much out of it, others
too.  I've been doing this awhile.)

But that aside, I always enjoy reading posts which tell me about the
people of Mozilla.  Just as I enjoy reading posts telling me about the
people of GNOME.  (I've been reading pgo for about as long as I've
read pmo; I don't even remember which I started reading first.)  I see
the occasional opinion with which I disagree, of course.  And that's a
good thing!  I also see the occasional post that I just don't care
about.  And I move on to the next one in short order.  In any case, I
want to know more than just the bland details of whatever someone's
current project is -- I want to know who they are, what motivates
them, what they do besides Mozilla, and so on.  An unvarnished,
unfiltered planet is an excellent way to get that.
