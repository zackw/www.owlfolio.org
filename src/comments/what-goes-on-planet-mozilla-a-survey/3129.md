If you enjoy having planet that personalizes the people on the project
and helps you learn more about them than the particular bits of code
or whatever that they're working on, you should speak up because those
who would have an editorial regime put in place are going to be vocal
about it. Let your voice be
heard. http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.governance/browse_thread/thread/6abe8b6a24eb3102/952101e4dd0bd0c7
