Funny. In the link I posted, the fonts were the exact opposite. Small
web fonts with no careful hinting.  All of them, to me at least,
seemed to do better under Linux.  And to my knowledge, that is due to:

Freetype's automatic hinter.

Again to my knowledge, OSX still does not use an automatic hinter, so
Linux font rendering on fonts *without* careful hinting, should be
superior, although the standard OSX high quality fonts should indeed
do better under OSX.

Of course, it might be true that at this point OSX is now using
Freetype.  That link dates back to early 2010.

And, as noted in those articles, you are correct, the patent expired
May of last year.
