It looks like "slight" hinting in that picture, which is similar to
what OS X seems to do (it still performs the hinting, but with less
impact on the final result)

In my setup, I use the auto-hinter by default, but enable the bytecode
hinter for fonts that I know have superior hints (like fonts by
Linotype or such)
