I think at least modern Ubuntu Linux defaults to ClearType-style
hinting (vertical hints only) rather than the "crisp" setting your
installation seems to use; at the very least I'd expect most Linux
users to get better-than-Windows font-rendering out of the box.

For those users that don't use the default font-rendering
configuration, that's why Firefox lets you untick "allow websites to
choose their own fonts". :)
