Out of curiosity: What version of Windows was that screenshot taken
with? If it was Windows Vista or 7, was DirectWrite enabled? If it was
Windows XP, was ClearType enabled?

The reason I'm asking is that with DirectWrite on, while that font
looks a little strange, it's nowhere near as bad as it is in your
screenshot: <a href="http://grab.by/9P88">http://grab.by/9P88</a>
