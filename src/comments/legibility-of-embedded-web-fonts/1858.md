I was oversimplifying on purpose; going into detail about all the
intra-Linux variations (and the intra-Windows variations -- GDI versus
DirectWrite, XP versus Vista, ClearType forced on or not...) would
have distracted from my overall point.  And sure, you can find fonts
that look better on Linux, or on Windows, but I think I'm on solid
ground saying that OSX has a better chance of doing a better job on
fonts that haven't been carefully hinted (which I have heard can be
nearly as much effort again as designing the font in the first place).

Incidentally, according to <a
href="http://www.freetype.org/patents.html"
>http://www.freetype.org/patents.html</a>,
Apple's patents on the hint interpreter have expired.

[p.s. I'm taking the liberty of folding your comments together]
