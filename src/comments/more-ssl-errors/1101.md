What I noticed with your ideas was that tampering and real cert
mismatch looks just like a self-signed cert screen from a fast look. I
think there ought to be some very apparent visual cue as to what is
inherently dangerous and what is "first-visit with unknown cert"
case. When people don't know them apart, they'll mistake the former
for the latter...
