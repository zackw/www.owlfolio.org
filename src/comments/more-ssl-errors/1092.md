One thing that would be useful would be a setting to whitelist sites
under certain domains, typically internal sites. I *know* our product
is invariably running with bad SSL certificates in our development
environments, and I don't care, because it's not a production setup.

Unfortunately, Firefox insists on telling me about the bad
certificates every time I hit a deployment I've not used before, and
the ability to tell it to not worry about that specific deployment
doesn't help much when they're relatively transient. In that regard,
Internet Explorer is actually better for me - it can't be told to
remember a given site, but it's just one click to bypass the warning,
where Firefox requires a lot more interaction.
