<blockquote>First of all, don’t let people use self-signed. Really,
just don’t. There is no need for that.</blockquote>

What about the HTTPS-based management interfaces of networked devices,
e.g. my ReadyNAS storage box?  You don't want to ship a signed cert
with the firmware, and there is no way of getting a trustworthy
signature onto the device at installation time.

The best thing I can come up with for that is, the manual instructs
you to attach a USB thumbdrive when you first turn the device on. The
device completely erases the thumbdrive, and writes a self-signed cert
to the root directory of the new partition.  The manual then walks you
through manually installing the cert as trusted-only-for-that-device.
Which we (Mozilla) make a less horrible process than it is now.
Better ideas welcome :)
