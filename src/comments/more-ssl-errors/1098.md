Perhaps, but compare it with the proxy settings dialog, where you
currently have an option to say "no proxy for these domains and IPs".

Is there value in the core browser at least having the concept of
trusted domains (much like IE's security zones), so that I can declare
machines on the company's internal network to be trustworthy - not
just for dubious SSL certificates, but as something extensions like
NoScript or FlashBlock could use?
