I can't say for sure; my sister handled nearly all interaction with
railway ticket offices and the like, and she's pretty good at Polish
for how long she's been there (about six months so far).  I didn't
have any trouble ordering food in restaurants, but that's not terribly
hard even when all you can do is point at the menu.

I have the impression that English is a pretty common second language
for native Poles in the big cities.
