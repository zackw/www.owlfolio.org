Zack, this is a great great great great writeup. Thanks for sharing
it--it's really wonderful to have this record of the trip in narrative
form. I'm so glad you guys came. It meant a lot to me, as you know. :)
And Simon, pretty much everyone under 30 in Poland speaks English very
well, and you'll have no trouble whatsoever at hostels, restaurants,
museums, arts places, etc. in Warsaw, Kraków and Wrocław; your only
issue will be with the train stations, actually, where many train
station employees either don't speak or don't want to speak
English. If you can get a (young) Polish person in the line to help
you, that's a good bet--otherwise, you want to have everything written
down on a piece of paper so you can point to it. I can give more
recommendations if you're coming!
