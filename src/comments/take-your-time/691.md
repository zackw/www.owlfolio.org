I really don't have a good answer to this one. I mean, the one time
I've won a roguelike (ZAngband), I did so by save scumming---and,
having won once, I haven't save scummed since. So somehow they got
away with it by making it part of the culture of the game, but beyond
that I really don't have a good explanation for it.
