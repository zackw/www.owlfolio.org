Two interesting aspects of rougelikes that might matter: First, if you
die, it's never because you didn't quite twitch your finger at the
right time -- no screens full of moving objects and if you touch one
you die; it can be legitimately claimed that all nethack deaths are
the player's fault for not planning better.  Second, when you do start
over, random generation means the game is totally different in detail,
so it's not "god I have played this level thirty times I am so bored
make it stop" like most modern games would be.

Not that I am a useful resource on games, since I never play them, but
maybe it gives a useful clue!
