I like the notion of sentient agencies advancing their own agendas.
It also might help with the thing where you can level up the party
until the final battle is an anticlimax: who's to say the end boss
hasn't been leveling up, too?  It can't just scale linearly, though,
because you want the player to feel that the leveling was some use - I
envision a curve where, say, you can fight the end boss at level X but
it's ridiculously difficult; at level X+5 it's much easier; X+10 only
a bit easier than X+5; X+20 not much point.

And then perhaps there can be in-story consequences to putting off the
endgame too long; not fatal ones, but maybe
not-getting-the-optimal-ending ones.  Works best in a context where
there's a range of outcomes, not just Win and maybe also Bonus Win.
Doing the endgame as soon as possible should be like doing a challenge
ascension in Nethack - significantly harder but also significantly
cooler.

Speaking of Nethack, I wonder how it is that contra all other games,
roguelikes manage to get away with making you start from scratch when
you lose.  Is it just that everyone is used to that in that genre (but
no others)?  Seems too simple.
