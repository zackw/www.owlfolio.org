Let me know if you have questions about WebGL.

I'm not sure what's meant with "have access to cross-domain content
that page JavaScript cannot see"; do you mean in the case of a very
serious vulnerability in the graphics drivers? In that case, we would
respond by blacklisting these drivers. We have blacklisted WebGL on
Mac OS 10.5 altogether for exactly that reason.

My main concern about WebGL is how it leaks more bits of uniquely
identifying information (fingerprinting). I'm available to discuss
this too if you are interested.
