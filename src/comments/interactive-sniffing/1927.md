Interesting and important to think about, but I don't see much to be
concerned about. Especially since each of these attacks requires the
user to first visit a malicious site, which is pretty rare, and then
to interact with it in a pretty extensive way, which is even rarer.

Also, I've anecdotally noticed that the incidence of such visits (by
the range of people I'm familiar with) has been decreasing gradually
over time as their online experience grows. (It would be wonderful to
get some data to find out if this is generally the case.)

And I'm happy to see that blocking 3rd party cookies by default is in
the plans for upcoming Firefox versions. I've been *pleading* for this
for a very long time. (That would resolve the Amazon issue, no?) ALL
user-specific 3rd party information should be blocked by default!
(Like XHR, visited links, etc.)
