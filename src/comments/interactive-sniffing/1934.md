I mean loading an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> or a
<code>&lt;video&gt;</code> cross-domain, pulling its contents into a
texture, and then looping over the pixels in a shader.  This is
allowed by the spec, but the resulting canvas contents are tainted, so
page JS can't read them.  But there may be a covert channel that the
shader can use to tell page JS what it saw - maybe only one bit
(rendering completion time?) but that would be enough for some
attacks.

Image contents are usually not that sensitive, but you never know.
