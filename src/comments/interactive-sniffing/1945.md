"You only need to steal a few AWS secret keys to make it worth the trouble."

Granted. But the keys (or secrets) stolen have to be important ones
and phishers can't be choosers. And as the importance of a secret
increases, so too does the number of security measures employed to
protect it. I'm not suggesting that a big breach can't
happen. (Importance isn't always recognised; Sony's recent issues ram
this point home, even if that was the result of a more traditional
'open backdoor'.) I'm suggesting the probability (or, rather, expected
cost) is low enough that these issues can be set aside in favour of
the holy grail: proper protection of all user-specific 3rd party
communications.

"The trouble is doing that without breaking the Web."

I would have thought the current situation is grievous enough for all
browser makers to unite and fix the problem --- there are plenty of
self-interest reasons to unite for this one. Have there been
discussions amongst the browser makers about it?
