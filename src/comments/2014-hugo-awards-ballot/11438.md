In fact, the main thing that pushed <i>The Wheel of Time</i> below No
Award for me was my objection to the rules allowing it to appear in
this category at all.  If the first volume had come out this year and
been nominated by itself I would have put it below <i>Parasite</i> but
above No Award.

I do credit the series for its influence on the genre and its devotion
to detail â€” but a similar level of devotion to detail could have been
achieved with far less padding.  I'm going to point at <i>The Witches
of Karres</i> again.  And <a

><i>The Shaving of Shagpat</i></a> (1856!)
