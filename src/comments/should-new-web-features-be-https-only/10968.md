IMO, only features with a clear connection to security and privacy
should be restricted to HTTPS. For example, getUserMedia. There's a
clear hit to security when a user selects "always allow this site to
access my camera" on an HTTP site.

Requiring HTTPS for all new features would hinder adoption of new
features more than it would speed up HTTPS adoption. Many of the new
features are better for security than the things they replace.

I'd also drop the "fully HTTPS" requirement. Mixed content is often
dynamic or page-specific, so things would seem to break at random
(unless you also required an STS/CSP header to forbid mixed display
content).
