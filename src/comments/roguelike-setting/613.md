psshh, comments, when I can just *tell* you....

anyway, what I just said to you right now, so you remember:

One of the cool things about Nethack is that the bone files are
shared.  If you maintain the world state, it ought to be shared
between users, but it ought to also be possible for new users to begin
at the beginning of the experience tree too, even with the Faerie
world already having been altered.  And the different players should
be able to work against each other.

I think a good name is Jimmy.
