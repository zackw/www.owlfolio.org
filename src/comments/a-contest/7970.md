You are correct: the joke is citing this fictional character as if he
were a real person.  The last volume of the <em>Illuminatus!</em>
trilogy contains several appendices, one of which is described as the
text of a pamphlet written and published, within the fictional
universe, by Hagbard; the intended reference is to this pamphlet.
Citing the last volume as an independent work, <em>Leviathan</em>,
rather than the better known omnibus edition, was just to make it less
obvious.

Hagbard's pamphlet does not anticipate the Internet as such, but it
does recognize the increasing importance of mass communications
(specifically, in 1975, television) to politics, the overt and covert
attempts of various entities (both fictional conspiracies and real
political actors) to control the message, and speculate that one day
TV will be replaced by a more effective medium, which will then become
the focus of those attempts at control.
