Yeah, I'm specifically looking at a roguelike with the above
comments. A roguelike is kinda by definition a "kill monsters and take
their stuff" game.

Avoiding that tie, you can go to a game that is entirely skill based
(no levels, but you can't improve your skills fighting stuff that is
below your skill level beyond a certain point), or one that detaches
the non-combat/magic skills from your level- the "craft" skills could
be their own branch of the skill tree. And if you want to tie it to
level or combat prowess without doing so directly, you say "to improve
your skill, you need this new kind of ore, which oh look only appears
in this area with higher level monsters."

Whether I would tie all skills to combat level in zwol's
roguelike-to-be depends on what the skills end up being. :)
