This was essentially UO's old system. Though unused skills didn't
decay on their own, but only if you hit the cap of how many points you
could have in skills. At that point if you raised one, another one
went down. Anyway.

This leads to the Quest For Glory syndrome- players spending an hour
bored out of their skulls climbing a tree over and over to get their
Climb skill raised, locking and re-picking the same door, etc etc. In
theory it's a great idea, IMO, but in practice it's really hard not to
create something where the powergamer feels obligated to bore himself
to death getting skills up way before he needs them, just because they
are available to be raised.

Also, wrt unpracticed skills, keep in mind the time frame of the
game. If you've been playing for a while but in character it's only
been a few days, you shouldn't already be losing unpracticed skills.
