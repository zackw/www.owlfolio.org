WRT "scutwork," for those who just want to build stuff (we don't do
that since we like the effort of building and putting together
materials, and mass production in groups of 64 is not that onerous for
most things) you can just whitelist the `/give` command.

Then they can pretty much `/give` themselves anything they like, by ID or name.
