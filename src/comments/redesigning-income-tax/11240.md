I suggest you may want to read up on the idea of a basic guaranteed
income. It isn't a new idea and studies have been done on it. It
works.

Your example is not real. It isn't "sit home and make $24K or work and
make $30K." You get the $24K whether you work or not (in this
example). If you earned another $30K, it would be on top of that for a
total of $54K. That's part of the point. The idea is that citizens are
guaranteed enough money to live, eat, and put a roof over their heads
so we don't have people starving, being homeless as much, or otherwise
living in extreme poverty.

Most people link this also with national healthcare (with which I
suspect you are familiar) and then a dismantling of welfare and
certain other social programs, since a guaranteed income and
government healthcare will effectively replace the need for many of
them.
