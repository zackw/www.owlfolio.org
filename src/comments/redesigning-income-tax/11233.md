I don't know how tax rate works in the US, but considering it works
the same in the few countries where i know how it works, I'll guess
it's the same in the US. And tax rate is *not* a step function. When
you switch tax rate section, the actual tax rate for your income is
not /that/ tax rate for the entire income. For example, taking
approximate numbers from your graph, if your income is, say $130k,
your tax rate is 29%... on the $30k above $100k. The rate is then 25%
for the part between $65K and $100K, etc. All in all the amount of tax
you pay vs. income is a *continuous* function, with its slope changing
at the income points where the tax rate changes.
