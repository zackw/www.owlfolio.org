I'd look more at the Sphinx/docutils suite of tools. reStructuredText
is actually quite good at integrating small pieces of content into a
larger project. Sphinx might not be billed as a static site generator,
but it could easily be used for such things. It also has at least some
support for not rebuilding stuff (although it doesn't do it by
integrating with the VCS -- but I'm not clear why you want that when
you can mostly just look at mtimes). Also, Jinja is the best
templating language I've used (and does auto-escaping by default).
