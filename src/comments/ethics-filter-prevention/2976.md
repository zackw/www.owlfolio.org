I am fascinated that you would prevent your child watching a
particular movie for practical reasons ("school tomorrow") but not for
the reason that you thought the content was in itself inappropriate or
immoral or corrupting. My reading of your comment is that you barely
admit the existence of the category. It seems to me that this can be
for only one of three reasons; either a) you don't believe that what a
child watches, reads or hears has any effect on the formation of their
moral character, or b) you have no interest in your child forming a
particular moral character, but are content to let it be formed by the
action of whatever inputs he or she happens to come into contact with;
or c) you think there's no such thing as "moral character" (and
therefore, it would seem to me, deny the existence of morality in
general).

Which is it? Or is there a d) I've missed?
