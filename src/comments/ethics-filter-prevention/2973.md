This is a really good question, and I don't have a good answer for it.
In a better world, where people all lived under jurisdictions that
they were personally comfortable with, it would be logical to say that
the jurisdiction of the writer applies.  But that's very much not the
world we have, and the "Arishat wants to write something that
Arishat's own government disapproves of" scenario is, alas, going to
remain relevant to these discussions going forward.
