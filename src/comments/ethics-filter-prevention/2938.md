I would argue that more information always works better than less
information.  Cato has no right to stop Arishat under any
circumstances.  <i>However</i>, Cato has the right to talk too, and
attempt to supply information of his own.

Regarding your proposed set of rules, they look good with a couple of
notable bugs:

First, "versus anything short of legal process" does not work; your
threat model needs to include "legal" process as something potentially
hostile.  Any loophole you leave open for legal process will get
abused.

Second, Cato should have complete and total control over his own
publication space.  While in principle I agree that viewers of that
space ought to have some knowledge of the changes over time, including
any removed content, that remains up to Cato.  Services like the
Internet Archive can provide useful third-party verification, but Cato
himself should have no requirement to make the changes to his site
auditable.

Finally, Cato has a recourse if Arishat publishes something harmful
about Cato: Cato can publish his own information countering what
Arishat published.  Let the truth and evidence win.  If any process
exists to compel Arishat to change what she published, even a noisy
public process, that process will get abused.
