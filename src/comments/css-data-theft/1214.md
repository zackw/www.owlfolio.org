Why not just prohibit the use of cookies for cross-domain loading of
`<link>` tags?  It seems like, even with all this fragile Content-Type
filtering, information can still be leaked if a website stores private
info in CSS.  For sites that allow users to apply custom styles that
is not unrealistic.

Even if the threat model regards CSS as somehow inherently public,
it's hard to see any non-malicious use for loading CSS (or other link
tags) from a different domain using cookies that are not available to
the main page's server.
