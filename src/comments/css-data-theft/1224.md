I suppose I'm being a bit more paranoid here than there.  <i>Right
now</i> escaping { and } is enough (you could probably get away with
escaping only {, even).  However, it's not beyond the realm of
imagination that some CSS3 or CSS4 module will add a special rule that
makes the browser load an arbitrary URL without any curly braces being
involved.  However however, if such a thing ever happened, the special
rule would have to involve an @-sign, because that's how the generic
extensible syntax in CSS 2.1 works.  So escaping @ is defensiveness
against possible future extensions.  ... in a hypothetical future
browser that has these extensions but doesn't block this attack, which
is perhaps not worth worrying about, especially now we know IE9 does
block it.
