I have yet to see a random password generator extension that I could,
in good conscience, recommend to nontechnical users.  They all seem to
need a little too much hand-holding, particularly when their default
character set doesn't match what a site wants.

Also, random password generators tend to produce things that are hard
to type correctly; there are still many contexts where you need to set
a password on a website and then type it into some other program.
