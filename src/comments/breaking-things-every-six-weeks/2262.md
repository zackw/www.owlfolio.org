Well, obvious cruft that still needs fixing/removing:

* Replacing XBL1 with a saner component model now that we have a better idea of what that would be like.
* Replacing the old somewhat-insane XUL flexbox model with CSS3 flexbox.
* Rearchitecting block layout.
* Rearchitecting inline layout.
* Changing the method signatures on nsISupports (e.g. changing the ABI/API of QueryInterface).
* Finishing changes to how we store the DOM tree.
* Better DOM bindings.

That's in addition to things like IonMonkey, changes to align better with html5/webapps and so forth.

In brief, you name it it probably needs improvement.  This is not exactly isolated to Gecko.  ;)
