Any Firefox criticism is systematically being ignored.

They don't care about 3rd party developers, power users, or regular
users for that matter.

They have endless excuses as to why each and every opinion of
disagreement does not count.

In short, it's their way or highway, and they've made it, and their
arrogance, very clear.

I invite everyone to do their share to reduce Firefox market share.

Tell to friends, colleagues, family -- and insist they uninstall
Firefox or better yet, do the honors for them. It's all the more users
for competition. IE8/9 are actually quite usable.

The time has come to regain liberty from evil tyranny, the tyranny
that is Mozilla.

In the end, Mozilla will learn they've taken the long path of digging
their own grave.
