"Other things that should have been recognized as bad ideas: NSPR."
How true. I never understood why it was necessary to recreate the
types (bool for example) that are already in the stdlib.

I also did some refactoring some time ago and remember one of the
changes was rejected because it broke a frozen interface. Or wait, it
was not frozen but extensions depended on it? Hm no matter. It`s good
to hear that some of that cruft is finally being cleaned up.
