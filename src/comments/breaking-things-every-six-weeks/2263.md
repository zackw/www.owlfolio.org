Most of the modules have had their owners since before MoCo even
existed, so your point about ownership having been obtained via MoCo
employment is demonstrably false.

"the pain of people who don't ship Firefox" exists because the
majority of the Mozilla *project* believes that Firefox is the best
tool we have to have an impact on the Web, and to fulfill Mozilla's
mission. It's not a "MoCo vs. the community" issue at all.
