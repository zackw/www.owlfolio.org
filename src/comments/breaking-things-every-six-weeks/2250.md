A couple of things I'm curious about (not an extension dev though)

Dave seemed to believe that feature detection in extensions was not
possible full stop, yet you're saying that they do ... or is that just
XPCOM? Having something similar to the feature detection web devs get
definitely seems to be the way forwards though.

Also, do you have any prediction on what the reaction will be from
devs who use binary components? Will they welcome someone finally
pulling that trigger?

I know I'm going to be hurt a little by it, since one of my critical
extensions is a gestures extension with binary components which has
been all but dropped by the developer, so I've just been relying on
the compatibility reporter and hoping that there's no changes that
will break it to get me through. I know I'll probably have to move on
from it eventually, but it's just such an excellent extension.
