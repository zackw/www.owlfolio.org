Thanks Zack, this is one of the best blog posts on this topic up to
date. Too bad Mozilla was not able to communicate this message much
earlier. I'm absolutely sure the people that decided on the rapid
release process did this change not without considering the
alternatives and weighting its problems and benefits. But I got the
feeling many had a hard time explaining their reasoning.
