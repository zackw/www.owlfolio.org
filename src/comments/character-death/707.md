Have I mentioned Planescape:Torment, as far as cool in-game dealings
with character death? The whole plot of the game is centered around
figuring out why you wake up in the mortuary again every damn time you
die. They took one of the most fictionbreaking aspects of a lot of
RPGs and made it the point of the game.
