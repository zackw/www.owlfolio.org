I like the user-driven access control work, too.  However, I think
they sell a rosier picture than the truth: there are a non-trivial
number of things that are very difficult to represent with access
control gadgets. They cherry-picked their examples to be ones that are
easy to represent with trusted UI.  In some cases, to get around
problems, their proposed trusted UI ends up being equivalent to a
consent dialog (e.g., a camera button that says "Permanent access"
next to a picture of a camera that you press at some point in time
before the camera actually starts).

A question I've been thinking really hard about lately is how to
quantitatively measure the impact on developers and functionality of
different types of trusted UI, to help figure out whether trusted UI
is the right way to go.  I haven't come up with a good answer yet.
