The people designing cryptographic hashes have gone to considerable
trouble to ensure that two different documents are overwhelmingly
likely to have different fingerprints.

They have <i>not</i> gone to any particular trouble to ensure that two
different documents are overwhelmingly likely to have fingerprints
that differ by more than one bit (except as an accidental byproduct of
other desirable properties).  In other words, your claim that "any
documents you work with (in your lifetime) wonâ€™t hash to similar
fingerprints" is only true by accident, and is not something to be
relied on.

I have personally seen Git produce collisions on the first 7
characters of a hash, and I'm sure there are dozens within any
repository of significant size.
