Please, no.

There are only a moderate number of font formats common on today's
web. Why not just give each their own proper MIME type and be done
with it?

I can see no particular reason to deviate from what is done for
image/video formats, other than to the complex set of exceptions that
is today's web.  You yourself present two reasons why not to do it,
but no list of pros.

MIME types get used as meta-data in circumstances way beyond HTTP
delivery to web browsers, and are often the basis for deciding which
applications/libraries can handle a format.  You can't expect every
font handling app to support all font formats on one MIME type.

Again, just because use in today's browsers doesn't need more than one
MIME type for fonts is no excuse for doing this poorly.
