‘If we needed a type per format, the Right Thing would clearly be to
register a top-level font/ category.’ Then the right thing is the
right thing to do, want me to write an RFC?

Just imagine if the right thing hadn’t been adhered to:

    application/image?type=png
    application/video?type=avi&amp;codec=…

OMG NO

The more timely option here (standardisation) is the one to
take. Suggest font/otf, font/woff and just start using it.
