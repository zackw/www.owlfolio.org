"Cities" like the one in the demo can be procedurally generated pretty
easily. Modeling more realistic cities like you've linked to the point
where you can actually fly through them is a *huge* amount of
work. It's not an artistic or architectural statement, I think, it's
just not really a reasonable amount of work when you're looking for a
quickie proof of concept tech demo.
