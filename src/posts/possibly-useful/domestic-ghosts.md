So your house is haunted.  You don't know who the ghosts were in life,
and you're maybe a bit scared to find out, but you would like to
gently encourage them to let go of their troubles and move on.  I have
for you a simple ritual involving a little of the old rune-magic.

You will need these materials:

 * A small piece of paper.  A 3x5" card is plenty big enough.  The
   paper does not need to be anything special, but ideally it would
   be unlined, heavy, and an unremarkable color, the sort of thing you
   would write a formal invitation on.
 * A pen, marker, or writing brush whose ink is not soluble in water
   or alcohol.  The ink should be black or dark blue.
 * A small glass (no more than one mouthful of liquid) of whatever you
   would drink at a memorial wake for a close friend.  If you're not
   sure what would be appropriate, red wine is a safe choice.  If you
   never drink alcohol, fruit juice will serve.  Do not, however, use
   plain water or any variety of milk.
 * Something with which to attach the paper to the inside wall above
   your front door.

Draw the following seven symbols on one side of the paper, as big as
you can.  It would be a good idea to use a pencil and a ruler to
divide up the space so you don't start too big and then have to cram
the last few in at the end; it's important that the first three and
the last three have equal significance.  Leave a little extra space on
either side of the middle symbol.  Erase any pencil marks after you're
done.

These are Old Norse runes.  They don't add up to a word in Icelandic
or anything like that; we are using them for the meanings of the
individual letters, which are:

* **ᚦ** THORN, a curse, a misfortune, a hammer; ghosts are a curse to the
  living, but they are also themselves cursed, unable to leave the
  world where they no longer belong.  Draw this one backward—with the
  point to the left—to make it the symbol of what we seek to bring to
  an end.
* **ᛟ** OTHILA, inheritance, fate; the cause of the curse; whatever debts
  the ghost may owe the world, or the world owe the ghost, that keeps
  it here.
* **ᛁ** ISA, ice, the nature of the curse: something that cannot change
  when it should.
* **ᛃ** JERA, years, time, change, the cycle of life.  This is the pivotal
  rune of the working.  All things, both good and ill, shall pass away
  in their time, and new things shall come in their place.  No joyful
  thing can endure forever, but neither can any curse.
* **ᛖ** EHWAZ, horse, motion.  What is frozen shall move again; what is
  trapped shall be released.
* **ᛞ** DAGAZ, daylight, dawn, emergence.  The end of a curse, the
  lifting of a burden, the forgiveness of a debt.
* **ᚹ** WUNJO, joy, blessing, liberty.  The negative of THORN, and the
  intended outcome of the working.

At twilight, take the drink and the paper and stand just inside the
open doorway of your house, facing outward.  It is better to do this
on the first night after a new moon, but if there is some urgency to
the matter you don't need to wait.  Dip one finger into the drink and
trace the first of the runes with it; repeat for each rune.  (This is
called _staining_ the runes.  The tradition here originally calls for
blood, but for an amateur working involving the dead, that would be an
unwise choice.)

Next, attach the paper to the inside wall above the doorway, with the
runes facing the wall (that is, blank side visible, runed side toward
the outside of the house).  Take care not to mar the rune lines with a
pinhole or a glob of sticky goo or anything like that.

Step to one side of the doorway, raise the glass and recite a short
prayer for the dead, from whichever religion you feel the most
emotional connection with.  If you have no emotional connection to any
religion at all, make up your own brief benediction.  I can't help you
with that, because it has to be emotionally meaningful for _you_.
Drink the drink, all in one go.  Close the door.

Leave the paper in place for a complete lunar cycle (29 days).  At
weekly intervals during this time, repeat the part of the ritual where
you stand to one side of the open door at twilight, say a prayer for
the dead, and drink.  At the end of the cycle, again at twilight, take
the paper down and carry it through the door.  Standing just outside,
hold the paper at one corner with tongs, set fire to it, and recite
the prayer for the dead while it burns.

If the paper falls down by itself during the lunar cycle, that means
the ghosts have already departed.  Leave it where it fell until the
next twilight and then burn it as above; you don't need to continue
with the ritual after that.

Come back if it doesn't work.
