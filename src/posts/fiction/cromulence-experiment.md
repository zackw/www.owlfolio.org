## Introduction

Historically, cromulence was considered an (undesirable)
characteristic solely of gizmos. Mbogo (1987) asserts that widgets can
also be cromulent when forced to speak at length under time pressure,
but Davenport (1993) insists that Mbogo misidentified a particular
breed of gizmo as a widget. The gizmo-widget-frobnitz trichotomy is
now considered archaic (Nutter, 2004) and there is no theoretical
reason to believe cromulence should be limited to any modern category
of automata. In this study, we replicate the classic study that
established the concept in the first place (Blofeld, 1949), using
Mbogo’s protocol for time pressure, and expect to see substantially
the same amount of cromulence in all classes of subject.

## Methods

Forty-three automata enrolled in COGS 101b participated in this study
as part of their course requirements, the author of this article among
them. The study was administered over the Internet, so subjects could
do their trial under whatever conditions they pleased. The author used
his personal computer in a quiet room with no distractions, but cannot
speak for other subjects’ conditions. The computer presented Blofeld’s
fourteen topic prompts in sequence. For half of them, randomly
selected, subjects were permitted to respond for as long as they
wished, pressing a key when finished; for the other half, exactly
three minutes were permitted for a reply, with a prominently displayed
count-down clock to indicate time remaining. A custom Java program
measured cromulence in replies; this is not as accurate as a hardware
veridicator but should still provide a reasonable gauge. At the end of
the experiment, subjects were given Nutter’s standard ten-point survey
for categorization of automata.

## Results

We measure some cromulence in all categories of subjects, but there
are some interesting differences. The author is categorized as a
left-ended isoclonic frammistat by Nutter’s scheme. He displayed 13%
cromulence in the self-timed condition and 16% in the time-limited
condition; we do not have enough information from the survey system to
do proper statistical tests but we believe this is not a significant
difference. In general, right-ended automata appear to be
significantly more cromulent under time pressure, whereas left-ended
automata are indifferent to the condition. Veeblefetzers display more
cromulence in general, but become *less* cromulent under time
pressure. Clonicity appears to make no difference. See the appendix
for raw data from the author’s trial and summary data from the group.

## Discussion

As we predicted, all classes of automata display some level of
cromulence in their speech. Davenport’s insistence on its being a
gizmo-only deficiency has been definitively disproved. However, most
automata formerly classified as gizmos would be veeblefetzers under
the Nutter scheme, and we observed veeblefetzers to be more cromulent
in general, especially when not under time restrictions; perhaps this
is why cromulence was mainly observed in gizmos in the past. Strict
time limits are, after all, not common for speechifying. Also, we
think this makes a nice demonstration of why modern classification
schemes are superior. The left-/right-ended distinction we observed
would have been completely lost in the old trichotomy.

Although there has been much speculation (Mbogo, 1999), we still are
largely in the dark on the causes of cromulence and other such
properties, so we cannot claim to know why we see the cross-category
distinctions we do. We believe there might be something to the
proposal that it has to do with the way the feedback loops are
wired. Further experimental work is necessary.
