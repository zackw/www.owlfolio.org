I'm switching Owl's Portfolio over to a new comment system of my own
invention, which will allow me to turn comments back on without (I
hope) immediately being inundated with spam. For the next few hours,
though, all of the comments made with the old system will temporarily
vanish.

The management hopes this is not a horrible inconvenience for the two
or three people still reading this site.
