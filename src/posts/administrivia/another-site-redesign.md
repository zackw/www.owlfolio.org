title: Another site redesign

This site is now running on [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) rather
than the creaky combination of [Ikiwiki](https://ikiwiki.info) and
comment software of my own invention. Things generally look nicer, in my
opinion, and should also be more reliable.

I apologize in advance if this causes the RSS feed to spew old posts all
over [Planet Mozilla](http://planet.mozilla.org) or your feed reader. I
hope it won't, but you never know with RSS.
