I really like
[Leonard's suggestion](http://www.crummy.com/2007/10/15/3) of
consistently applying the notion that one gets better at what one
practices. I am wondering whether it is practical to do away with
character attributes as well as levels, and rely exclusively on
skills, or perhaps I should call them aptitudes. There is an enormous
list of these, and they are all organized in some sort of cluster
network by how closely related they are. If you spend all day swinging
a long sword, you get better at that; but you also gain a few points
in closely related skills, like bastard sword and saber. You *lose* a
few points in other skills like rapier and dagger; the notion is that
you've got entirely the wrong habits for those weapons. The higher
your actual practiced skill is in something, the less it's affected by
practicing other skills, even if they interfere. And, as
[queenpam](http://queenpam.livejournal.com/) points out while reading
this over my shoulder, unpracticed skills decay.

Is this good enough to cover all the times when the computer's got to
pick a random number, is the question.
