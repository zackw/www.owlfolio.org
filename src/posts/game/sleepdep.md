title: 'Effects of Sleep Deprivation: a generic RPG supplement'

Many RPGs have some basic notion of fatigue penalties, but they lack
color. On the more cyberpunk end of the spectrum, you got to figure
the PCs are regularly sneaking around late at night. It's harder to
stay awake for days on end in a setting without electric light, but
players still do come up with those sneaky plans that involve, well,
sneaking around late at night. There's tons of amusement value being
left on the table due to a lack of fleshed-out-ness.

## Conventions

I assume that your RPG system has some (probably dice-based) mechanism
for deciding whether an action succeeds, subject to numeric modifiers.
In this supplement, positive modifiers are bonuses, negative modifiers
are penalties, and the smallest possible modifier is ±1.

Modifiers apply to some subset of actions, described after the number.
For instance, "−1 to mental actions" means a penalty of 1 to every
action that involves thinking. Since this is a generic supplement, I
avoid talking about specific character statistics. One exception:
"initiative" is the mechanism for deciding who gets to act first in
adversarial situations (e.g. combat).

From this point on, "you" refers to the character suffering sleep
deprivation.

## Tracking sleep deprivation

You have a new statistic: the amount of sleep you require. The default
for this is the requirement for normal adult humans: eight hours per
24-hour day. When you don't make your sleep requirement, you
accumulate an hour of *sleep debt* for every extra hour fully
awake. You must spend extra time asleep in the future to pay off the
debt. Until then, you are subject to penalties.

Even if you spend all the necessary time resting, you might not make
your full sleep quota for various reasons: light, noise, vibration,
chronic pain, uncomfortable position or surface, etc. For simplicity,
we just say that eight hours of "disturbed" sleep, whatever the cause,
is equivalent to seven hours of fully restful sleep.

If you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle and remain awake for
more than a few minutes, that is "interrupted" sleep. Interrupted
sleep is not as bad as not sleeping at all, but not as good as
continuous sleep. For each hour of wakefulness inside a sleep cycle
that, taken as a whole, meets your sleep requirement, you suffer half
an hour of sleep debt.

Sleeping too much can also add sleep debt, by throwing off your
circadian rhythm. This is at the GM's discretion, but should never add
more than an hour of debt in total.

Sleep debt is repaid at a rate of one hour per sleep cycle, plus two
hours for every extra hour of sleep. It cannot be repaid faster than
six hours per sleep cycle, under normal circumstances (see below).
Thus, an adult human who regularly gets only seven hours of sleep a
night will remain at one hour of sleep debt indefinitely, and a single
all-nighter will take at least two days to recover from.

If you deliberately go to sleep (for any period) while suffering more
than 24 hours of sleep debt, you might collapse from exhaustion! See
below.

### Permanent modifiers

If your basic sleep requirement is permanently different from the norm
of 8 consecutive undisturbed hours per 24-hour day, you have a
character advantage or disadvantage, requiring a rationale and subject
to GM approval. For instance:

* You are a robot, so you need no sleep at all. (Racial advantage.)
* Thanks to a quirk of genetics, you need only six hours of sleep a
  night. (Personal advantage purchased at character creation.)
* You suffer insomnia: all your sleep is interrupted, and you can
  sleep no more than 1d4−1 extra hours a day (roll daily) to make up
  for it. (Personal disadvantage sold at character creation.)
* Cybernetic modifications allow you to derive full rest from
  interrupted sleep, and delay sleep for up to 48 hours with no
  penalty, but you must still get 24 hours of sleep in any 72-hour
  period. (Personal advantage, can be purchased as an upgrade.)

### Stimulants

Anything that compensates temporarily for sleep debt is a stimulant.
Stimulants have two statistics: strength and duration, both measured
in hours. When you use a stimulant, your effective sleep debt is
reduced by the stimulant's strength, for its duration. Here are some
sample stimulants:

* Regular coffee, caffeinated soda: strength 1, duration 4
* Double espresso, No-Doz: strength 3, duration 4
* Amphetamines: strength 5, duration 5

These all happen to be chemicals, but cybernetic stimulant "chips,"
magical sleep compensation, and whatever else you can think of should
fit into these rules as well.

Strength stacks, but duration does not. Thus, two cups of coffee and a
shot of speed will compensate for seven hours of sleep debt, but only
for four hours; then the coffee wears off and you're left with five
hours' compensation for the remaining hour that the amphetamines are
effective.

Stimulants become less effective if used habitually: adjustments are
at the GM's discretion, but as a guideline, daily use should start
reducing the duration after a couple weeks, and more-than-daily use
should eventually reduce the strength. A serious stimulant habit will
trigger withdrawal symptoms when you stop; again, as a guideline, one
extra hour of sleep debt for every week of habitual use, which you are
stuck with for at least one week.

You cannot fall asleep while under the influence of stimulants, unless
the effect tables say you do.

### Sleep enhancers

There are two kinds of sleep enhancer. One kind simply converts
disturbed or interrupted sleep into normal sleep: for instance,
anti-insomnia medicine. Another kind allows you to pay off sleep debt
faster, by raising the "six hours of recovery per cycle" cap and/or
allowing each hour of sleep under the influence to pay off more than
one hour of debt. There are no real-world drugs with this effect, but
in a high-tech future there certainly could be, likewise healing
magic.

### Naps

Taking a nap in the middle of a day is surprisingly helpful. If you
intentionally nap for one hour, that will subtract 1d4 hours from your
sleep debt. However, if you have at least 8 hours of sleep debt, you
might collapse from exhaustion.

You cannot nap while under the influence of stimulants, and for
simplicity's sake, you cannot nap for more than an hour---it becomes a
regular interrupted sleep cycle.

### Collapse from exhaustion

When your limbic system just will not permit any more time awake, you
collapse. This happens in three different circumstances:

* If the major sleep deprivation effect table says so.
* If you have at least 8 hours of sleep debt, attempt to nap, and roll
  4 on the d4.
* If you have at least 24 hours of sleep debt, you must flip a coin
  when you go to sleep for any length of time, whether deliberately or
  because of a deprivation effect. If it's tails, you've collapsed.

However it happens, once you collapse you will remain asleep for as
many hours as your total sleep debt, unless forcibly awakened.
External stimuli that would normally be sufficient to cause disturbed
sleep are not enough to wake up someone who has collapsed. A bucket of
ice water will do it, though.

If forcibly awakened, the collapse does not help *at all*. If you are
allowed to wake up on your own, however, your sleep debt is reset to
two hours.

### Interaction with other game mechanics

You can either treat the sleep-debt mechanic as separate from other
sources of fatigue penalties in your game system, or you can combine
them. If you combine them, I recommend converting fatigue penalties to
additional hours of *effective* sleep debt at a ratio of one to two,
but continuing to let them wear off as specified in your core rule
set. For instance, a PC who pulled an all-nighter for eight hours of
true sleep debt, and then played a strenuous basketball game which put
them at −2 due to fatigue, would suffer 12 hours of effective sleep
debt instead of the −2 penalty, but four of those hours would wear off
as specified for the original penalty instead of being paid back by
extra sleep.

## Effects

With at least one hour of *effective* sleep debt (that is, after
subtracting stimulant strength and adding other fatigue modifiers) you
suffer a −1 penalty to all mental actions. Every additional two hours
of sleep debt adds another −1 to mental actions, to a maximum of −4.

With at least two hours of effective sleep debt, you suffer a −1
penalty to all physical actions. Again, every additional two hours
adds another −1, to a maximum of −4.

With at least three hours of effective sleep debt, you must, once
every hour that you remain awake, roll against the master sleep
effects table. This table directs you to the specific effect tables.
Follow the instructions in the Tables section, below.

If you are on stimulants, you must, once an hour, roll against the
stimulant effects table.

All effects stack; a character with maxed-out basic penalties can and
will suffer additional penalties from the sleep debt and stimulant
tables.

### Effect Tables

Effects last for a full hour unless otherwise specified.

#### Master Sleep Debt Table

Roll 1d4 and add one-third of your effective sleep debt, rounded

2.  You have achieved *[zanshin][]*, the state of no-mind.
    For this hour, all current penalties for physical action are
    suspended; instead you have a *bonus* of +2 for physical action,
    and a +2 to initiative. However, you are at an additional −2 on
    top of current mental penalties to act other than on reflex.

    but examine it. If someone takes it away from you, you find another
    one to fixate on.

20. You collapse from exhaustion.

### Hallucinations

Roll 1d20. Hallucinations last until the next hallucination or effect
roll. The GM should elaborate on them so they don't get repetitive.
Making up your own hallucination table is encouraged.

1.  The world looks like a Monet painting.
2.  You keep thinking you saw a rabbit hiding behind something.
3.  You can see the auras of living things. +1 to empathy; −1 to
    physical actions, due to disorientation. If you already have this
    ability, you find you can't turn it off.
4.  A nearby piece of furniture is talking to you.
5.  You can hear the ticking of the gears in your head as you think.
6.  Advanced philosophy makes sense.

10. A short, bald fellow in brown clothes, carrying a shotgun,
    inquires whether you have seen any wabbits around here?
11. You understand foreign languages you have never heard
    before. Which is a good thing, because everyone around you is
    speaking one.
12. You put out your hands and fall through the window. Clawing at
    nothing, you drop through the void; your terrified screams are
    inaudible, drowned in the spiral ahead.
13. You can hear the ticking of the gears of the clock that drives the
    universe. You feel insignificant next to such immensity.
14. You see a white rabbit with pink eyes about ten feet away. It
    takes a watch out of its waistcoat pocket, looks at it, exclaims
    "Oh dear! I shall be too late!" and dives down a hole.
15. You are much too big for this room. Your head is scraping the
    ceiling; your arms can reach both walls at once.
16. Your phone rings; it's someone you know to be dead.
17. You doze off for a few minutes; when you awake you discover that
    everything around you has been removed and replaced with an exact
    duplicate.
18. Post-modern literary criticism makes sense.
19. There are bugs crawling on everything. EVERYTHING.
20. You are in the presence of the Prince with a Thousand Enemies. His
    ears glow faintly of starlight. You hear him whisper to you the
    secrets of the universe.

## Author's Note

The [original version][] of this supplement was written in December
2002, as an exercise in pure silliness instigated by Sumana. This
marginally less silly version occurred to me as a way of getting my
writerly brain back in gear after a long time doing nothing but
coding.

As always, fabulous no-prizes are available to those who spot the
references.
