title: Things I Like and Don't Like about Nethack

The voices in my head have decided that I am going to write a roguelike
game. They are unlikely to get their way because (a) I don't have time,
and (b) I am not sufficiently familiar with the space of existing
roguelikes to do something genuinely new. I've played a lot of Nethack,
but never ascended; I tried (Z)Angband a couple times but I was severely
put off by the non-persistent dungeons and gave up on it. I've never
even looked at ADOM, and I'm sure there are others.

However, I'm going to scribble down the ideas banging around in my head
anyway. Maybe something will come of it. In this post I'm going to
concentrate on the virtues and flaws of Nethack, which I know very well.
Virtues:

-   The game starts off a challenge and remains that way as far as I
    have ever gotten (killed by a cockatrice after finding the vibrating
    square but before fighting Rodney).
-   The dungeon persists; that is, once you have seen a level, it will
    be the same for the entire game. This is self-evidently the Right
    Thing and I do not understand how anyone can stand to play a
    roguelike that doesn't do it.
-   Relatedly, each level of the dungeon fits on the standard 80x25
    terminal. I am of two minds about this one; there are places where
    one would really like to have bigger levels, notably the Quest.
    However, it helps the player keep everything straight in their mind.
-   It is said that The DevTeam Think Of Everything; that is, just about
    any action you can think of works and has logical, often useful,
    consequences.
-   There is a huge diversity of enemies, and the enemy AI is pretty
    darn good, although not as good as it could be.
-   The game's interaction with you is witty and culturally rich.

Not so much virtues:

-   The basic game mechanics are borrowed from first edition D&D and are
    really showing their age. The state of the art in tabletop
    hack-and-slash is much nicer to work with, not to mention easier to
    explain to players.
-   I lean toward thinking that the class system is also a relic of the
    past that should go. I like the class specific quests but I don't
    like the huge variation in starting abilities (although you could
    argue that this is handy for replay value).
-   It is too damn hard to identify items safely. If I had a dime for
    every time I've been killed while lugging around objects that could
    have saved my bacon if only I'd known what they were...
-   The equipment optimization space has only a few, obvious global
    minima.
-   Artifacts are neither as diverse nor as interesting as they ought to
    be. Here I have a specific idea: I'd like to borrow the way magic
    weapons work in [*Earthdawn*](http://www.earthdawn.com/).[^1] You find
    a magic item, it does something not terribly exciting, but you can
    discover and complete side quests that unlock more and more of its
    powers. Naturally, the side quests get harder as the rewards get
    better.
-   The middle game can get very tedious; lots of trekking back and
    forth to item caches and altars, exploring dozens of maze levels,
    etc.

Outright flaws:

-   The overall goal is kind of boring â€” when you get down to it, it's
    just a MacGuffin hunt. If I were actually going to write a roguelike
    this is the big thing I would like to change.
-   Starting players are too much at the mercy of the RNG for equipment.
    Given that you are supposed to have been the chosen one of the god
    and prepared from youth for the quest, and that it is known that the
    dungeon is dangerous, you would think your instructors would have
    chipped in for decent armour, or at least enough food rations that
    you wouldn't starve to death in the first few levels. (This
    interacts with the class system badly, too. If you were some punk
    kid with no particular skills and no holy mission it would make more
    sense that you have only the gear you do.)
-   The code is a crawling horror, and the DevTeam's secrecy strictures
    make it impossible to tell whether there *is* any ongoing
    development. I infer from the way the known-bug list on
    [nethack.org](http://nethack.org) keeps growing that there is some
    life there, but given its size, a bug-fix release is years overdue.
