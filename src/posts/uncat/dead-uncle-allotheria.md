Summaries of the rest of [CCS'10](http://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2010/)
are still coming eventually, but what I want to talk about today is
the [Difference Engine No. 2](http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/)
which I have now seen demonstrated twice: Mozilla had its annual
meeting at the [Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/)
a couple years back, and on Saturday last I was there again for
[SRI](http://www.sri.com/)'s holiday dinner.

As you know, (Bob,) the Difference Engine was originally designed in
the 1820s by
[Charles Babbage](http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/charlesbabbage/);
a tabletop-sized demonstration version was built, but the full-size
version was abandoned in 1833 after Babbage fell out with the
mechanist he had hired. Babbage went on to design the Analytical
Engine, which if completed would have been a fully operational
stored-program computer, and later to redesign the Difference Engine
with only eight thousand (instead of 25,000) parts. Having blown
Â£17,500 of Parliament's money (more than a million pounds at current
rates) on the first failed project, he was not able to secure funding
for either of these, and they remained drawings only. The
[London Science Museum](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/) built two
copies of Difference Engine No. 2---that's the 8000-part version---in
the 1990s, with period-appropriate materials and manufacturing
tolerances, to prove that it could have been done; one of these is on
display at the Computer History Museum.

The Difference Engine is not a computer in the modern sense, or even a
desk calculator. It does one thing only: it computes
[tables of values of mathematical functions](http://functions.wolfram.com/About/history.html). You
approximate the function you want as a polynomial of up to 7^th^
degree (you probably need several polynomials, for different ranges of
the argument) and you can then have the Engine calculate the value of
the polynomial for many different inputs, using
[finite differences](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FiniteDifference.html). It
stamps the numbers into a bed of
[plaster of Paris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaster), which can
then be used to cast a letterpress plate and run off many copies of a
book. There were already such books, but they were computed by hand,
and notorious for their errors. The Difference Engine's failure meant
that they kept on being computed by hand; however,
[Georg and Edvard Scheutz](http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/georgedvardscheutz/)
managed to build a miniature version of the Engine in 1857 and use it
to print a table of logarithms; also, the
[first practical mechanical desk calculator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmometer)
went into production in 1851, and was no doubt employed in making
tables more accurate.

Nowadays, of course, we could program an electronic computer to
typeset such a book, but why would we bother, when the very same
computer can just spit out exactly the values we're interested in, of
any function we want? In other words, the spiritual descendants of the
Analytical Engine have not only obsoleted the Difference
Engine---which I'm sure Babbage himself would have expected---but have
made the *job it was made to do* a thing of the past. This hardly ever
happens, and nobody (except possibly
[Vannevar Bush](http://hdl.handle.net/2027/spo.3336451.0001.101) or
[Murray Leinster](http://www.baen.com/chapters/W200506/0743499107___2.htm))
saw it coming---witness the Heinlein juvenile of forgotten title in
which the spaceship *had* an electronic computer to navigate it, but
to make it work, the human navigation team had to *type in numbers
from a book of tables*.

At the demonstration, several people in the audience did not seem to
believe, even after it was repeated several times, that no Difference
Engines were ever built in Victorian times. This one is a replica?
they kept asking. Nope. Production model, serial number two, of the
only production run there ever was. It does seem odd to me that,
before now, it was so fervently believed that Babbage's engines *could
not* have been built with Victorian manufacturing technology, when
they manifestly *did* build similar devices, such as the Scheutz
brothers' difference engine and various desk calculators.

The other telling question was on the order of "if you set the Engine
up wrong, what happens?" Being so special purpose, of course it can't
have a bug of the sort we are all used to. Its gears can get out of
alignment, but it's got a mechanism to detect that and jam rather than
produce an incorrect sum. (I don't know how the operator would recover
from such a jam, however.) And no matter how you set it up, it will
compute *some* polynomial; but that might not be the polynomial you
wanted. Babbage himself
[was asked this question, in a less-coherent form](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage)
(look for "On two occasions").

I'll leave you all with
[a vision of what might have been](http://sydneypadua.com/2dgoggles/).
