   alt="Semi-anthropomorphic sketches of six owls, each with a different
        facial expression and labeled with the name of a different
        coffee-related beverage: decaf (asleep), half-caf (awake, but
        not happy about it), regular (a little more awake and still
        not happy about it), Irish coffee (cheerfully buzzed),
        espresso (unable to blink), double espresso (oh dear, it's
        gone all the way to knurd).">
