title: Ideas that don't make money

The sad Internet news of this week is that the multiplayer online
game/community [Glitch](http://www.glitchthegame.com/) will have to
[shut down next month](http://www.glitchthegame.com/closing/). The
announcement makes it sound like mostly a financial problem (not
enough revenue to keep going), with a side order of getting caught
between technology curves.  They built the desktop client on Flash,
which is on its way out now, but the technologies that will replace it
are not completely ready yet; meanwhile, Flash is mostly not available
at all on "mobile" devices but they didn't have the engineering
manpower to build a whole new client for each such platform.

This is a personal disappointment for me, since I liked the game, but
it's also not the first time I've seen an Internet community built
around a compelling idea fall apart because the money wasn't there.
Something very similar happened to
[Metaplace](https://www.raphkoster.com/2009/12/21/metaplace-com-closing/)
and
[Faunasphere](https://web.archive.org/web/20110223115622/http://massively.joystiq.com/2011/02/20/faunasphere-shutting-down-on-march-15th).
It's not just games; [the WELL](https://www.well.com/), paragon of
elder days, had to be bought out by its users, and this was only
possible *because* it goes back to elder days and has users who are
very, very rich. [TV Tropes](https://tvtropes.org/), timesink par
extraordinare and valuable resource for high school English students,
is ad-supported so it keeps getting
[jerked around by Google](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/posts.php?discussion=13344112380A34560100&page=1).

You get the idea: the ecology around the Web is only capable of
supporting ideas that bring in the money. It doesn't really matter how
good the idea is on its own terms, or how desirable it is to its
audience if that audience isn't big enough to provide enough money.
Kickstarter and the like help with that last bit, but they don't work
for things that need *lots* of money or a *continuous* stream of
money. Glitch staff quoted a figure of six million U.S. dollars a year
to keep the game running, which is comparatively small for a
business---thirty-ish people at $100,000/yr, plus however much the
servers and the connectivity cost, plus overhead. But *one* million
dollars is
[extraordinary for a Kickstarter project](https://www.kickstarter.com/discover/most-funded).

The requirement for a continuous stream of money to keep the servers
running also hurts things on the Net that *were* successful but are
now declining. I can still play
[Super Mario World](https://www.mariowiki.com/Super_Mario_World) any
time I want; even after the original hardware stops working
altogether, there will be emulators. But I can't go back to
[Star Wars Galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Galaxies),
and I'm not sure if I should believe
[the website that's telling me I *can* still play Uru Live](https://mystonline.com/en/play/).
Again this isn't just about games; we all remember what happened to
[Geocities](http://archive.org/web/geocities.php).

[Free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) helps,
but not enough, because it's not enough to be in possession of all the
code and data that you need for a client-server MMO. Some specific
person or group has to actually run the server, and now we're back to
that continuous stream of money requirement---most of which will be
going to people, not to computrons or tubes. You might not need
developers, but you definitely need sysadmins. I was a sysadmin in
college, for a tiny little computer lab that almost never had crises
at four in the morning, and it was *still* a shitload of work. For an
MMO you also need in-game and out-of-game moderators, which is even
more difficult and thankless a gig than sysadminning, and while people
*do* sometimes volunteer to do it for free, often those are exactly
the people who should not be doing that job (yeah, I'm looking at you,
Reddit).

Is there a solution? I don't have one. I think it's more a problem of
capitalism than a problem of software architecture.
