Foliomatic is a hypothetical program for generating web sites like
this one. Iâ€™m on my fifth CMS, having gone through
[Blosxom](https://web.archive.org/web/20221104183206/http://www.blosxom.com/),
[Ikiwiki](https://ikiwiki.info/),
[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/),
[Pelican](https://getpelican.com/),
and now [Metalsmith](https://metalsmith.io/).
Each in turn has been
_somewhat_ of an improvement on what preceded it, but all of them
have gotten in my way enough to irritate me.

Unlike the game designs I have devoted many words to, I do intend to
write Foliomatic someday, but it might be a good long time. Meanwhile,
here are notes.
